## Reasoning

The given Java EE file `beans.xml` is an XML configuration file used to enable Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) in Java EE applications. The file contains the schema location and version number of Java EE specifications.

The issues described in the input information require updating the schema location and version number to the Jakarta EE equivalents, as Jakarta EE has taken over the maintenance of the Java EE specifications. Additionally, the `beans.xml` file is not required in Quarkus as CDI is enabled by default.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` in all occurrences in the file.
2. Change the schema version number to the corresponding Jakarta EE version number.
3. Remove the `beans.xml` file as it is not required in Quarkus.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- Empty file -->
```

## Additional Information

Since the `beans.xml` file is not required in Quarkus, it can be safely removed from the project. However, if you want to keep it for compatibility with other Java EE applications, you can update it as described above and add it to the Quarkus project.

To add the file to the Quarkus project, you can place it in the `src/main/resources` directory instead of `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`. Make sure to update the imports in your Java code accordingly.

Regarding the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file, you may need to update them to their Jakarta EE equivalents. For example, if you have a dependency on `javax.ejb:ejb-api:3.1`, you should update it to `javax.enterprise:cdi-api:2.0` and `javax.enterprise:ejb-api:4.0`.

Here's an example of how to update the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!-- ... -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>ejb-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <!-- ... -->
</dependencies>
```
