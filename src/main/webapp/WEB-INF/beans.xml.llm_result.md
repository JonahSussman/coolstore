## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. The primary issue to address is Issue 5, which suggests removing the `beans.xml` file as it is not necessary in Quarkus. CDI is enabled by default in Quarkus, so there is no need for a marker file.

2. The other issues (Issues 1-4) are related to the XML schema used in the `beans.xml` file. However, since we are removing this file, there is no need to address these issues.

3. If the `beans.xml` file were necessary in Quarkus, we would need to update the XML schema as suggested in Issues 1-4. This would involve changing the namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and updating the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd`.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- Empty file, not needed in Quarkus -->
```

## Additional Information

Since we are removing the `beans.xml` file, there are no additional steps needed. However, if you were to keep this file for some reason, you would need to address Issues 1-4 as mentioned in the Reasoning section. Additionally, you would need to ensure that any dependencies in the `pom.xml` file that are related to Java EE are updated or removed as necessary for Quarkus. Since we are removing the `beans.xml` file, there are no changes needed in the `pom.xml` file.
