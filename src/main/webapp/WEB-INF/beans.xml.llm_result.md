## Reasoning

1. The `beans.xml` file is being replaced with the Quarkus equivalent.
2. The `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` namespace is being replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`.
3. The schema version number needs to be updated to `"3.0"`.
4. The `beans_1_1.xsd` file is being replaced with `beans_3_0.xsd`.
5. The `bean-discovery-mode` attribute is being set to `"all"` to enable CDI feature in Quarkus.
