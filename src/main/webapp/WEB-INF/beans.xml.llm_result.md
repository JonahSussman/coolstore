## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is the namespace used in the `beans.xml` file. The namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` needs to be replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` to comply with the Jakarta EE specification.
2. The second issue is the schema location and version number. The schema location `beans_1_1.xsd` needs to be updated to `beans_3_0.xsd` and the version attribute needs to be set to `"3.0"` to reflect the updated CDI specification version.
3. The `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored in Quarkus, as Quarkus uses its own dependency injection framework. Therefore, the `beans.xml` file can be safely removed from the application.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- This file can be removed as it is not used in Quarkus -->
```

## Additional Information

It is important to note that when migrating to Quarkus, the application will no longer rely on the Java EE CDI framework. Instead, Quarkus uses its own dependency injection framework, which is more lightweight and optimized for cloud-native applications. Therefore, it is essential to review and update any code that relies on Java EE CDI annotations or configurations.
