## Reasoning

1. The first step is to understand the issue found in the static analysis. The issue is about session replication and its configuration in a clustered environment. Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by node failure, but in a cloud environment, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart.

2. The recommendations are to review the session replication usage, ensure it is configured properly, disable HTTP session clustering, or re-architect the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.

3. In Quarkus, there is no direct support for session replication as in Java EE. Instead, Quarkus promotes the use of stateless applications and RESTful services. Therefore, the best approach is to re-architect the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.

4. Since Quarkus is an opinionated framework, we need to remove the `web.xml` file as it is not needed in Quarkus.

5. We also need to remove the `distributable` tag as it is not applicable in Quarkus.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- This file is not needed in Quarkus -->
```

## Additional Information

1. In Quarkus, we can use the Infinispan subsystem to manage distributed caching. This can be used to store and manage sessions in a clustered environment.

2. We also need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies related to Java EE session management and add any new dependencies required for Quarkus, such as Infinispan.

3. We need to update the imports in the Java code to remove any imports related to Java EE session management and add any new imports required for Quarkus.

4. We need to update the Java code to use the Infinispan API for session management.

5. We need to test the application thoroughly to ensure that session management is working as expected in the clustered environment.
