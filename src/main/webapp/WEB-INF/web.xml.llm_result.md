## Reasoning

1. Reviewing the session replication usage in the provided `web.xml` file indicates that session replication is currently enabled through the `<distributable>` tag.
2. However, as mentioned in the issue description, session replication may not be the best option for cloud environments where data in memory can be wiped out by a restart.
3. To address this, we can consider disabling HTTP session clustering and accept its implications, or re-architecting the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.
4. In this case, we will disable HTTP session clustering by removing the `<distributable>` tag.
5. This change will impact the `pom.xml` file, as we will no longer need the `jboss-web` dependency for session replication.
6. Additionally, we will need to remove the import for the `javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet` annotation, as it is no longer needed.

## Additional Information

1. After disabling session replication, it is important to consider alternative methods for managing session data, such as using a cache backing service or a remote data grid.
2. It may also be necessary to update any code that relies on session replication to ensure proper functionality.
3. These additional steps will be addressed in subsequent migrations.
