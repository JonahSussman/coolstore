## Reasoning

Given the issue described, it appears that the current web.xml file does not contain any configuration related to session replication or handling of sessions in a clustered environment. The recommendation is to either review and configure session replication properly, disable HTTP session clustering, or re-architect the application to store sessions in a remote data grid.

Since the input file does not contain any session replication configuration, it seems that the best approach would be to either disable HTTP session clustering or re-architect the application to use a remote data grid for session storage.

Disabling HTTP session clustering can be done by removing the `<distributable>` element from the web.xml file. This will prevent the application server from clustering sessions and each node will manage its own sessions. However, this approach has some implications:

1. The application will not be able to survive node failures as session data will be lost when a node is restarted.
2. The application will not be able to share sessions between nodes.

Alternatively, re-architecting the application to use a remote data grid for session storage would provide more benefits such as scalability, elasticity, and session data survival during node failures. This approach would require significant changes to the application and is beyond the scope of this step.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the recommended approach would be to remove the `<distributable>` element from the web.xml file to disable HTTP session clustering.

## Updated File

```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">

</web-app>
```

## Additional Information

Quarkus does not support web.xml files out of the box. Instead, configuration is done through application properties or annotations. Therefore, the next steps would be to remove the web.xml file and configure session handling and any other necessary settings using Quarkus-specific methods. This may involve updating the pom.xml file to include Quarkus dependencies and making changes to the application code.
