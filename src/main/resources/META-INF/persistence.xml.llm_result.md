## Reasoning

1. The first issue is about updating the XML namespace and schema location to the Jakarta EE equivalent. This is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, not Java EE, and the namespaces and schema locations have changed accordingly.
2. The second issue is also about updating the XML namespace and schema location for the persistence.xml file. This is the same reasoning as issue 1, but for the second occurrence of the namespace and schema location in the file.
3. The third issue is about updating the schema version number to 3.0. This is necessary because Quarkus supports Persistence API 3.0, and the schema version number in the XML file needs to reflect that.
4. The fourth issue is about updating the version attribute to 3.0 in the root tag of the persistence.xml file. This is necessary to indicate that the file conforms to Persistence API 3.0.
5. The fifth issue is about renaming properties prefixed with "javax" to "jakarta" in the properties section of the persistence.xml file. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE naming convention for properties, not the Java EE naming convention.
6. The sixth issue is about moving the datasource and persistence configurations from an XML file to a properties file. This is a best practice in Quarkus, as it allows for centralization of the configuration and makes it easier to manage.

## Updated File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="
        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd"
             version="3.0">
    <persistence-unit name="primary">

            <property name="jakarta.persistence.show_sql" value="false" />
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.format_sql" value="true" />
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.use_sql_comments" value="true" />
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys" value="false" />
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
```

## Additional Information

Make sure to update the JTA data source name in the pom.xml file to reflect the new naming convention used by Quarkus. For example, if the original Java EE data source was defined in the standalone.xml file, you would need to create a new datasource in the application.properties file and update the JTA data source name in the persistence.xml file accordingly.

Also, note that the example provided assumes the use of OpenJPA as the JPA implementation. If you are using a different JPA implementation, such as Hibernate, you would need to adjust the JTA data source name and the JPA implementation class accordingly.
