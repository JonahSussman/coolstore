["1. The first step is to address the issue found from static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. In this case, the import statement to change is `import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` package namespace used in Java EE.\n\n2. The next step is to remove the `Serializable` interface implementation. Quarkus uses a different mechanism for serialization and deserialization, so there is no need to implement the `Serializable` interface.\n\n3. The `promotionSet` field is initialized in the constructor, which is not necessary in Quarkus. Quarkus uses field injection instead of constructor injection, so the `promotionSet` field can be initialized directly.\n\n4. The `getPromotions()` method can be simplified by removing the null check and the creation of a new `HashSet` object.\n\n5. The `setPromotions()` method can be simplified by removing the null check and the creation of a new `HashSet` object.\n\n6. The `toString()` method is not necessary in Quarkus, as Quarkus uses a different mechanism for logging and debugging."]
