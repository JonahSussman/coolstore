["To migrate the `PromoService.java` class from Java EE to Quarkus, we need to address the issue pointed out by the static code analysis as well as consider any other potential adjustments to make the code compatible with Quarkus. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Replace `javax.enterprise` import with `jakarta.enterprise`:** The issue highlighted is a common one when migrating from Java EE to Jakarta EE, which Quarkus uses. This change is necessary because Quarkus, as part of the Jakarta EE ecosystem, has moved from the `javax` namespace to `jakarta`. This impacts how CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) is used in the application.\n\n2. **Review the class for CDI compatibility with Quarkus:** After changing the import, we need to ensure that the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation and CDI usage are compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus supports CDI, so this annotation should work as expected, allowing the bean to be application-scoped.\n\n3. **Inspect for any additional Java EE dependencies:** While the provided code does not directly indicate the use of other Java EE-specific APIs beyond CDI, in a real-world scenario, it would be essential to review the entire project for other Java EE APIs that might require migration to their Jakarta EE counterparts.\n\n4. **Update `pom.xml` dependencies (if applicable):** While the provided information does not include a `pom.xml` file, migrating to Quarkus usually involves adding Quarkus dependencies and potentially removing or replacing Java EE/Jakarta EE dependencies with Quarkus equivalents. For example, if there were dependencies for Java EE's CDI, they would be replaced with Quarkus starter dependencies.\n\n5. **Review application properties:** Migrating to Quarkus might require changes or additions to the `application.properties` file, especially if there are application configurations related to CDI or other Jakarta EE features being used. This step is not directly applicable to the provided code but is important in a full migration scenario.\n\nNow, let's update the file based on the issue to fix and the reasoning above."]
