["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with the Quarkus framework.\n2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is being moved to the field declaration. This change is a best practice in Quarkus, as it allows for more fine-grained configuration.\n3. The `Serializable` annotation is being removed, as Quarkus automatically handles serialization and deserialization.\n4. The `HashMap` and `HashSet` instances are being replaced with `Map` and `Set` instances, respectively. This change is more in line with the Quarkus idioms.\n5. The `promotionSet` field is being marked as `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is consistent with the previous change and allows for more fine-grained configuration."]
