["1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. However, since the `@Stateless` annotation is not used in Quarkus, we will remove it.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection in Java EE, but in Quarkus, we use the `@Inject` annotation from the `javax.inject` package. Since we are using this annotation, we will keep it.\n3. The `CatalogService` is being injected, but we don't know if this is a managed bean or a CDI bean. In Quarkus, we use the `@Inject` annotation to inject dependencies, but we need to make sure that the `CatalogService` is a CDI bean or a Quarkus-managed bean.\n4. The `CatalogService` is being used to get the `CatalogItemEntity` list, and we are converting it to a `Product` list. In Quarkus, we can use a `Mapper` to convert one object to another. We will create a `Mapper` for this conversion.\n5. We will remove the `Transformers` class since we are creating a `Mapper` for the conversion.\n6. We will update the `pom.xml` file to include the required Quarkus dependencies.", "1. The first step is to understand the issue found by the static code analysis. The issue is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace for the Jakarta EE APIs.\n2. The next step is to analyze the input file, `ProductService.java`. This file is a Java class that provides methods for managing products in a catalog. It uses dependency injection through the `@Inject` annotation to get a reference to a `CatalogService` instance.\n3. The input file does not have any external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file, so there are no changes needed in this area.\n4. The input file has an import statement for `javax.inject.Inject`, which needs to be changed to `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n5. There are no changes needed in the imports for the classes `com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity`, `com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product`, `com.redhat.coolstore.service.CatalogService`, `java.util.List`, `java.util.stream.Collectors`, and the static method `toProduct(CatalogItemEntity entity)`.\n6. The constructor `ProductService()` is not needed and can be removed.\n7. The class `ProductService` does not need to extend `AbstractCdiBean` in Quarkus.", "1. The first step is to understand the issue found from the static code analysis. The issue is that a Stateless EJB is used in the JavaEE code, which can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n2. In the given JavaEE code, there is no usage of EJB related functionality. Therefore, it is safe to remove the EJB dependency and convert it to a CDI bean.\n3. The `CatalogService` is being injected using the `@Inject` annotation, which is a part of CDI. So, the code is already using CDI for dependency injection.\n4. The `CatalogService` is being used in the `getProducts()` and `getProductByItemId()` methods. Since the `CatalogService` is already being injected, no changes are required in these methods.\n5. The `toProduct()` method is a static method that converts `CatalogItemEntity` to `Product`. Since it is a static method, it can remain unchanged.\n6. The `pom.xml` file will not be affected by this change, as there are no external dependencies related to EJBs."]
