["1. The `javax.ejb` package is being replaced with `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is being replaced with a Quarkus service.\n3. The `toProduct` method is being replaced with a Quarkus transformer.\n4. The `getProducts()` method is now using the new `Stream` and `Collectors` APIs.\n5. The `getProductByItemId()` method is now using the new `Optional` and `Either` APIs.", "1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Quarkus does not support the `javax.persistence` package, so it needs to be removed.\n3. The `SessionContext` class is used for Hibernate session management, which needs to be replaced with `SessionContext.getCurrentSession()`.\n4. The `CatalogService` class is not present in the Quarkus example, so it needs to be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent.\n5. The `Transformers` class is not present in the Quarkus example, so it needs to be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent.", "1. The `ProductService` class is currently implemented as a stateful session bean (`@Stateless`). To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to convert it to a CDI bean with a scope.\n2. Quarkus supports CDI beans with the `@ApplicationScoped` scope. Therefore, we should replace the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. The `getProducts()` method currently retrieves all catalog items and converts them to products. We can optimize this by using Hibernate's criteria API to retrieve the products directly.\n4. The `getProductByItemId()` method currently retrieves the catalog item directly and converts it to a product. We can optimize this by using Hibernate's criteria API to retrieve the product directly.\n5. The `CatalogService` is not shown in the input file, but it will likely be needed to retrieve catalog items by ID."]
