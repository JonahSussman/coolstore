["1. The `javax.ejb` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` in the `ProductService` class.\n2. The `CatalogService` class should be annotated with `@QuarkusService` to enable Quarkus features.\n3. The `getProducts()` method should be changed to use `Stream API` and `toProduct` function from `Transformers` library.\n4. The `getProductByItemId()` method should be changed to use `Optional` and `Mono` from ` reactive-streams-tck` library for reactive programming.", "1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. The `CatalogService` is an external dependency that needs to be updated in the pom.xml file.\n3. The `toProduct` method is a utility method that converts a `CatalogItemEntity` to a `Product`.\n4. The `getProducts` and `getProductByItemId` methods are now using the `Mono` type for reactive programming.", "1. The Java EE code uses `@Stateless` annotation for the ProductService class. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace it with a scope annotation.\n2. Quarkus supports CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for managing beans.\n3. To use CDI scope, we need to change the `@Stateless` annotation to `@ApplicationScoped`.\n4. The ProductMapper interface is already using CDI beans, so no changes are required there.\n5. The ProductService class now uses `@Inject` for dependency injection, which is a Quarkus best practice.\n6. The `getProducts()` method now returns a `Mono` instead of a `List`, which is a Quarkus reactive programming best practice."]
