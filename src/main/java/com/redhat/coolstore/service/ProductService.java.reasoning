["1. The `javax.ejb` package is being replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus.\n2. All the imports in the `ProductService` class should be updated accordingly.\n3. The `CatalogService` class is not present in Quarkus, so it needs to be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent.\n4. The `Transformers` class is not present in Quarkus, so it needs to be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent.\n5. The `toProduct` method is not present in Quarkus, so it needs to be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent.", "1. We need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` in the `ProductService` class.\n2. The `Transformers` class is replaced with a Quarkus equivalent using the `Transformation` interface.\n3. The `toProduct` method in the `Product` class is replaced with a Quarkus equivalent using the `@Inject` annotation.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation for the `ProductService` class. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace this with a scope annotation. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is commonly used for this purpose.\n\n2. The `Product` class has a constructor that takes a `CatalogItemEntity` as an argument. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject dependencies. We also need to create constructors for the `Product` class that take the `id`, `name`, and `description` as arguments.\n\n3. The `getProducts()` method uses the `stream()` method to iterate over the `CatalogItemEntity` list. We need to convert each `CatalogItemEntity` to a `Product` using the `toQuarkusProduct()` method.\n\n4. The `getProductByItemId()` method returns a `Product` if it exists, otherwise it returns `null`."]
