## Reasoning

1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.
2. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with the Quarkus framework.
3. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is being used to scope the PromoService to the application scope.
4. The `Serializable` interface is being used to ensure that the PromoService can be serialized.
5. The `HashSet` and `Map` classes are being used to implement the promotionSet and promoMap data structures.
6. The `getPromotions()` method is being used to retrieve a set of promotions from the promotionSet data structure.
7. The `setPromotions()` method is being used to set a new set of promotions on the PromoService.
8. The `applyCartItemPromotions()` method is being used to apply promotions to a shopping cart item.
9. The `applyShippingPromotions()` method is being used to apply promotions to a shipping charge.
10. The `toString()` method is being used to generate a string representation of the PromoService object.
