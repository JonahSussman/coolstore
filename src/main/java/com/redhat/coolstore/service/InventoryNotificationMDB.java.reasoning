["1. Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n\nThe `javax.inject` annotation is replaced with `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. This change is necessary to use the Quarkus dependency injection framework.\n\n2. JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel.\n\nIn Quarkus, JMS `Topic`s are replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s and fed through a Channel. This change is necessary to use the Quarkus metrics and tracing framework.\n\n3. References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n\nIn this example, the `javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory` and `javax.jms.TopicSession` classes are replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye equivalents, `io.quarkus.jms.client.TopicConnectionFactory` and `io.quarkus.jms.client.TopicSession`."]
