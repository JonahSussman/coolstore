["1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is now provided by Quarkus, so the `@Inject` annotation can be used to inject it.\n3. The `JMS_FACTORY` and `TOPIC` constants are now provided by Quarkus as well, so they can be used directly in the code.\n4. The `InitialContext` is no longer needed in Quarkus, as the `javax.naming.Context` interface is used instead.\n5. The `PortableRemoteObject` class is no longer needed, as Quarkus provides a more convenient way to narrow references.\n6. The `onMessage` method now uses the `javax.jms.MessageListener` interface and the `Message` class.\n7. The `init` and `close` methods are no longer needed, as Quarkus provides a more convenient way to manage connections and sessions.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `Topic` class for message listening, which needs to be replaced with Quarkus' `Emitter` and `Channel`.\n2. The `InventoryNotificationMDB` class now uses `@Inject` for dependency injection instead of the traditional `@Resource` annotation.\n3. The `onMessage` method now uses `Emitter.emit` to send messages instead of the `topic.publish()` method.\n4. The `InventoryNotificationMDB` class now has an `@Inject` annotated `@Channel` for the message topic.\n5. The `TextMessage` class is used to receive messages from the topic.\n6. The `Transformers.jsonToOrder` function is used to convert the JSON string received from the topic into an `Order` object.\n7. The `getCatalogItemById` method is used to retrieve the inventory information for the order item.\n8. The `LOW_THRESHOLD` constant is defined to check if the inventory quantity is below the threshold.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.jms` package for JMS functionality. In Quarkus, we need to use the `quarkus.jms` and `quarkus.smallrye.jms` modules for JMS.\n2. The `MessageListener` interface is replaced with `MessageListenerContainer` in Quarkus.\n3. The `TopicConnectionFactory` is replaced with `MessageEndpoint` in Quarkus.\n4. The `TopicSession` is replaced with `MessageSession` in Quarkus.\n5. The `TopicSubscriber` is replaced with `MessageListener` in Quarkus.\n6. The `TextMessage` class is used for message handling in Quarkus.\n7. The `InventoryNotificationMDB` class is annotated with `@Quarkus` and `@QuarkusApplicationClient` to configure the Quarkus application and use the `InventoryNotificationMDB` as a client."]
