["1. The first step is to address the issue found from static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` package namespace used in Java EE.\n\n2. The next step is to replace the JMS and JNDI dependencies with their equivalent Quarkus dependencies. Quarkus uses a different approach for managing JMS and JNDI resources, using the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API. This API provides a more simplified and reactive approach for handling message-driven beans.\n\n3. The `CatalogService` dependency needs to be updated to use the Quarkus CDI injection mechanism. This involves removing the `@Inject` annotation and using the `@Injectable` annotation instead.\n\n4. The `Transformers` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus JSONB API for converting JSON to Java objects. This involves replacing the `Transformers.jsonToOrder` method with the `JsonbBuilder.create().readObject` method.\n\n5. The `getInitialContext` method needs to be removed, as Quarkus uses a different approach for managing JNDI resources. Instead, the JNDI resources need to be defined in the `application.properties` file.\n\n6. The `init` and `close` methods need to be removed, as Quarkus uses a different approach for managing JMS resources. Instead, the JMS resources need to be defined in the `application.properties` file.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found in the static code analysis. We need to replace the usage of JMS `Topic` with Micrometer `Emitter` for the `inventoryNotifierChannel`.\n2. The `@Resource` annotation is used in Java EE to inject resources, while in Quarkus, we use the `@Inject` annotation. This change needs to be made for the `CatalogService` as well.\n3. The `CatalogService` does not seem to be a Quarkus managed bean. We need to make it a managed bean by adding the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation.\n4. The `copyOnWriteArrayList` is not needed in Quarkus as it provides a more efficient solution with `@ApplicationScoped` beans. We can change the `orderList` to be an `@ApplicationScoped` bean.\n5. The `System.out.println` statement is not a best practice in Quarkus. We can use a logger instead.\n6. The `ResteasyReactiveMessage` is not needed in the method signature. We can change the method signature to accept a `JsonObject` directly.\n7. The `ConfigProperty` annotation is used in Quarkus to inject configuration properties. However, the `name` attribute should follow the `smallrye.config.name` format.", "1. The first issue to address is the usage of JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements. In this case, the `@Incoming` annotation is used to consume messages from a channel, which is a SmallRye Reactive Messaging feature, not a JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS element. Therefore, no changes are required for this issue.\n\n2. The second issue is the usage of `List<Order> orderList` which is not a JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS element, but it is being used as a container for messages. In Quarkus, we can use the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API to handle messages. We can replace the `List<Order> orderList` with a `ReactiveMessage` to consume messages from a channel.\n\n3. The `CatalogService` is being injected using `InstanceHandle<CatalogService>`, which is not a JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS element. However, it is recommended to use the `@Inject` annotation directly on the field or method to inject dependencies in Quarkus.\n\n4. The `managedContext` is being used to activate and deactivate the context of the bean. In Quarkus, the context management is handled automatically, so we can remove the usage of `managedContext`.\n\n5. The `close()` method is a no-op, which means it does not do anything. In Quarkus, the JMS resources are managed automatically, so we can remove this method."]
