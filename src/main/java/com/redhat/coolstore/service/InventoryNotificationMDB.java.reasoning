["1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is now provided by Quarkus, so the `@Inject` annotation can be used to inject it.\n3. The `JMS_FACTORY` and `TOPIC` constants are now provided by Quarkus, so they can be used directly in the code.\n4. The `InitialContext` is now created using the `java.naming.Context` interface, which is part of Quarkus.\n5. The `PortableRemoteObject` class is no longer needed, as Quarkus provides a more convenient way to narrow references.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `Topic` class for message listeners, which needs to be replaced with Quarkus' `Emitter` and a `Channel`.\n2. The `InventoryNotificationMDB` class has a `onMessage` method that listens to messages on the `topic/orders` topic.\n3. The `onMessage` method receives a `TextMessage` containing order information, which is then converted to an `Order` object.\n4. The `Order` object's `itemList` is iterated through, and the inventory quantity for each product is updated based on the message content.\n5. The updated inventory quantity is then stored in the `Order` object.\n6. The updated `Order` object is returned to the client.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.jms` package for JMS messaging. Quarkus provides its own implementation, `io.quarkus.jms.SmallRyeJms`, which should be used instead.\n2. The `MessageListener` interface is not directly supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `Emitter` interface from `io.quarkus. reactive-streams-client`.\n3. The `CatalogService` is not directly provided by Quarkus. It should be replaced with a Quarkus-compatible implementation.\n4. The `JMS_FACTORY` and `TOPIC` constants are hard-coded. They should be replaced with configuration properties or environment variables."]
