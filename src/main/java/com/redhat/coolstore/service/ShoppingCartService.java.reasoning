["The task involves migrating a Java EE application to Quarkus, with a focus on addressing the specific issue of replacing `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb`. The migration process also requires considering other necessary changes to adapt the code to Quarkus, including dependency management, application configuration, and potentially, code structure adjustments.", "To migrate the provided Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to address the specific issue highlighted by static code analysis - replacing `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus, along with the rest of the Java EE ecosystem, has moved from the `javax.*` namespace to `jakarta.*` with the Jakarta EE 9 release. This change ensures compatibility with the latest specifications and libraries used in the Quarkus framework.\n\nAdditionally, since we are migrating to Quarkus, we should ensure that the code takes full advantage of Quarkus features such as CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) and MicroProfile REST Client for service invocations. The original code already uses annotations that are compatible with Quarkus, such as `@ApplicationScoped`, and `@RestClient`, indicating that the migration should be straightforward in terms of framework capabilities.\n\nFor the `pom.xml` changes, we need to ensure that the Quarkus dependencies are correctly added. This would typically include the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials), Quarkus REST Client, and any other Quarkus extensions that are relevant to the application, such as the Quarkus CDI extension. However, since the provided input does not include `pom.xml` contents, explicit changes to `pom.xml` cannot be detailed. The user is advised to add Quarkus dependencies accordingly, focusing on the Quarkus starter and any specific extensions like `quarkus-rest-client` and `quarkus-arc` for dependency injection.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that while the migration focuses on addressing the specified issue of namespace change from `javax` to `jakarta`, other potential migration issues or optimizations (e.g., native compilation, configuration properties, etc.) might arise depending on the broader context of the application. These are not addressed here due to the limited scope of the provided information."]
