["1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for EJBs, but Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ejb` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.ejb` with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `InitialContext` class is used for JNDI lookups in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides a similar API called `java.naming.Context` for JNDI lookups. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `InitialContext` with `Context`.\n3. The `Product` class is used for product information, but it is not a Quarkus-specific class. It can be used in Quarkus without any changes.\n4. The `PromoService` class is used for promotion information, but it is not a Quarkus-specific class. It can be used in Quarkus without any changes.\n5. The `ShippingServiceRemote` class is used for shipping information, but it is not a Quarkus-specific class. It can be used in Quarkus without any changes.\n6. The `shoppingCartOrderProcessor` field is used for processing orders, but it is not a Quarkus-specific class. It can be used in Quarkus without any changes.\n7. The `getShoppingCart` method is used to retrieve a shopping cart by ID, but it can be simplified to just `public ShoppingCart getShoppingCart(String cartId) { return cart; }` since the `cart` field is already initialized.\n8. The `checkOutShoppingCart` method is used to process an order, but it can be simplified to just `public ShoppingCart checkOutShoppingCart(String cartId) {\n    ShoppingCart cart = getShoppingCart(cartId);\n    shoppingCartOrderProcessor.process(cart);\n    cart.resetShoppingCartItemList();\n    priceShoppingCart(cart);\n    return cart;\n}` since the `getShoppingCart` and `priceShoppingCart` methods are already called.\n9. The `initShoppingCartForPricing` method is used to initialize the shopping cart for pricing, but it can be simplified to just `public void initShoppingCartForPricing(ShoppingCart sc) {\n    for (ShoppingCartItem sci : sc.getShoppingCartItemList()) {\n        Product p = productServices.getProductByItemId(sci.getProduct().getItemId());\n        sci.setProduct(p);\n        sci.setPrice(p.getPrice());\n        sci.setPromoSavings(0);\n    }\n}` since the `productServices` and `getProductByItemId` methods are already called.", "1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection, which is also compatible with Quarkus.\n3. The `Stateful` interface is used to maintain the state of the ShoppingCartService, which needs to be replaced with `@QuarkusApplicationScoped` in Quarkus.\n4. The `getProduct` method is used to retrieve a product by its ID, which needs to be replaced with `@Inject` and `@Getter` annotations in Quarkus.\n5. The `lookupShippingServiceRemote` method is used to retrieve the shipping service, which needs to be replaced with `@Inject` and `@Provides` annotations in Quarkus.\n6. The `initShoppingCartForPricing` method is used to initialize the shopping cart for pricing, which needs to be replaced with `@PostConstruct` and `@Inject` annotations in Quarkus.\n7. The `shoppingCartOrderProcessor` field is used to process the order, which needs to be replaced with `@Inject` and `@Autowired` annotations in Quarkus.\n8. The `productServices` field is used to retrieve the product service, which needs to be replaced with `@Inject` and `@Autowired` annotations in Quarkus.\n9. The `ps` field is used to retrieve the promo service, which needs to be replaced with `@Inject` and `@Autowired` annotations in Quarkus."]
