["1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. However, since Quarkus is a microservice framework and does not support EJBs, we need to remove all the EJB related code and dependencies.\n2. The `@Stateful` annotation is an EJB annotation, which is not supported in Quarkus. We need to remove this annotation and the associated EJB injection points.\n3. The `ShoppingCartService` class is a stateful session bean, which maintains state between method invocations. In Quarkus, we should use stateless session beans or CDI managed beans, which do not maintain state between method invocations. We can replace the `ShoppingCartService` class with a CDI managed bean.\n4. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a dependency on the `ProductService` and `PromoService` classes. In Quarkus, we can use CDI to inject these dependencies.\n5. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a dependency on the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class, which is not present in the provided code. We need to assume that this class is available and can be injected using CDI.\n6. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a method `priceShoppingCart(ShoppingCart sc)`, which calculates the price of the shopping cart. This method has a dependency on the `ShippingServiceRemote` interface, which is an EJB remote interface. In Quarkus, we can replace this EJB remote interface with a REST endpoint or a gRPC service.\n7. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a method `lookupShippingServiceRemote()`, which looks up the `ShippingServiceRemote` interface using JNDI. In Quarkus, we can replace this JNDI lookup with a REST endpoint or a gRPC service.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace for the Jakarta EE APIs.\n2. The next step is to remove any dependencies that are not needed in Quarkus. For example, the `Hashtable` import statement is not needed in Quarkus, so it can be removed.\n3. The `Logger` class is also not needed in Quarkus, as Quarkus provides a more lightweight logging mechanism using the `io.quarkus.logging` package.\n4. The `ProductService`, `PromoService`, and `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` classes are injected using the `@Inject` annotation. In Quarkus, these classes should be defined as CDI beans and registered with the CDI container.\n5. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a public constructor with no arguments. In Quarkus, it is recommended to use a no-arg constructor with the `@Inject` annotation instead of a public constructor.\n6. The `calculateShipping` and `calculateShippingInsurance` methods throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`. In Quarkus, it is recommended to use the `@Unsupported` annotation instead of throwing an exception.\n7. The `ShoppingCartService` class has a private field `cart` of type `ShoppingCart`. In Quarkus, it is recommended to use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to manage the lifecycle of the `ShoppingCart` object."]
