["1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for EJBs, but Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ejb` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.ejb` with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `InitialContext` class is used for JNDI lookups in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides a similar functionality through the `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager` interface. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `InitialContext` with `BeanManager`.\n3. The `Product` class is used to represent products in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides a similar functionality through the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Inject` annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations from the `Product` class and use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead.\n4. The `ShoppingCartItem` class is used to represent items in a shopping cart. Quarkus provides a similar functionality through the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Inject` annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations from the `ShoppingCartItem` class and use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead.\n5. The `PromoService` class is used to apply promotions to products in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides a similar functionality through the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Inject` annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations from the `PromoService` class and use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead.\n6. The `ShippingServiceRemote` class is used to calculate shipping costs in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides a similar functionality through the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Inject` annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations from the `ShippingServiceRemote` class and use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead.", "1. The `javax.inject` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. The `@EJB` annotation should be used to inject beans.\n3. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation should be used to scope the bean.\n4. The `Product` and `ShoppingCartItem` classes should be annotated with `@Entity` to enable database persistence.\n5. The `ShippingServiceRemote` interface should be replaced with a Quarkus service.\n6. The `WildFlyInitialContextFactory` class should be replaced with a Quarkus equivalent."]
