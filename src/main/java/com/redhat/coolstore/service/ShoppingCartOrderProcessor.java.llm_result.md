## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** Java EE and Jakarta EE use different packages for annotations. Java EE uses `javax.annotation` while Jakarta EE and Quarkus use `jakarta.annotation`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, EJBs are replaced by CDI in Quarkus. The `@Stateless` annotation is replaced by a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. **Issue 3:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package is replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus.

4. **Issue 4 & 5:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.jms` package is replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Quarkus.

5. **Issue 6 & 7:** Quarkus uses a different approach for publishing messages. Instead of using JMS `Topic`s, it uses Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a `Channel`. This change is necessary to use Quarkus's built-in messaging capabilities.

6. **Issue 8 & 9:** Similar to Issue 4, Quarkus uses a different package for JMS elements. The `javax.jms` package is replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Quarkus.

7. **Issue 10:** As mentioned in Issue 2, Stateless EJBs are replaced by CDI in Quarkus. The `@Stateless` annotation is replaced by a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.jms.JMSContext;
import jakarta.jms.Emitter;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "quarkus.jms.topic.orders")
    private Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    @Resource(name = "quarkus.jms.topic.orders")
    private String ordersTopic;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersEmitter.emit(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

In the updated file, we have replaced the `javax` imports with `jakarta` imports as required by Issue 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We have also replaced the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` as required by Issue 10.

Furthermore, we have replaced the `Topic` with `Emitter` and `String` as required by Issue 6 and 7. The `@Resource` annotation is used to inject the topic name as a string, which is then used to create the `Emitter`.

Note that the `Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart)` method may need to be updated to use a Quarkus-compatible JSON library such as `org.json` or `javax.json`.
