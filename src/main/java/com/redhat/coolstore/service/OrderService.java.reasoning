In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource.

If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created.\n\n3.

The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation for the OrderService class, which indicates that it is a stateless session bean. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation.\n2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used for CDI beans that should be managed by the application scope. In this case, we can use this annotation for the OrderService class."]
