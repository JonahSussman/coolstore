Quarkus does not support Hibernate by default, so we need to replace Hibernate-specific classes and methods with Quarkus alternatives.\n3. The `@Stateless` annotation is used to define a session bean, which is not directly supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@QuarkusStateless` annotation to define a Quarkus-native service.\n4. The `EntityManager` is obtained through the `@PersistenceContext` annotation, which needs to be replaced with the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistenceContext` class.\n5. The `SessionFactory` and `Transaction` instances are obtained through the `em.getSessionFactory()` and `em.getTransaction()` methods, which need to be replaced with the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistenceContext` class.\n6. The `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery`, `Root`, and `Session` instances are obtained through the `em.getCriteriaBuilder()`, `em.createQuery()`, `em.getCriteria()`, and `em.getSession()` methods, which need to be replaced with the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistenceContext` class.\n7.

The Java EE code uses the `javax.persistence` package for persistence operations. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.persistence` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. The `Session` and `Transaction` classes are part of the Hibernate library, which is not directly supported in Quarkus. Instead, we should use the `HibernateEntityManager` provided by Quarkus.\n3.

The `orderBy` method is being replaced with `orderBy` in Quarkus.", "1. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager.\n\n3. Otherwise, if the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.\n\n4. For instance, you can create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```\n\n5. and then inject your entity managers:\n\n```java\n@ExtendedContext\npublic EntityManager getEm() {}\n```", "1. The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation on the `OrderService` class, which indicates that it is a stateless session bean. To migrate this code to Quarkus, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n2. The `OrderService` class also uses the `@Qualifier` annotation, which is used to specify the name of the bean that should be used to obtain the `ExtendedContext` bean. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to obtain the `ExtendedContext` bean.\n\n3. The `OrderService` class imports the `javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject` class, which is used to define the interface for local EJBs. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to define the interface for the `OrderService` class."]
