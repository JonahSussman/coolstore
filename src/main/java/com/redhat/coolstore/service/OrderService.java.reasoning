["1. The `javax.ejb` package is being replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus.\n2. The `@Stateless` annotation is being replaced by `@QuarkusStateless` in Quarkus.\n3. The `EntityManager` is being replaced by `@Inject` in Quarkus.\n4. The `javax.persistence` package is not required in Quarkus, so it should be removed.\n5. The `CriteriaBuilder` and `CriteriaQuery` are being replaced by `JPA` methods in Quarkus.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` import statement, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. The `OrderService` class is a stateless session bean, so it should be annotated with `@QuarkusStateless` instead of `@Stateless`.\n3. The `Order` class should be annotated with `@QuarkusEntity` to enable Hibernate ORM support in Quarkus.\n4. The `getOrders()` method should be updated to use `Pageable` and `Sort` parameters for pagination and sorting.\n5. The `getOrderById()` method should be updated to use the `Long` type for the `id` parameter.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.persistence` package for persistence. In order to migrate this code to Quarkus, we need to replace this import with the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n2. The `OrderService` class is annotated with `@QuarkusStateless` and `@QuarkusEntity`, which indicates that it should be a Quarkus service and entity respectively.\n3. The `save` method is annotated with `@Inject`, which means that it should be injected with an EntityManager.\n4. The `findAll` method is annotated with `@QuarkusGet` and `@Path`(value = \"orders\"), which indicates that it should be a RESTful service method and map to the `/orders` endpoint.\n5. The `findById` method is annotated with `@QuarkusGet` and `@Path`(value = \"order/{id}\"), which indicates that it should be a RESTful service method and map to the `/order/{id}` endpoint.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.persistence` package for persistence operations. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.persistence` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n2. The `Order` entity is mapped by the `@QuarkusEntity` annotation. This annotation is used to configure the entity and its relationships with other entities in Quarkus.\n\n3. The `@QuarkusStateless` annotation is used to mark the class as a Quarkus Stateless service. This annotation is used to simplify the configuration and management of the service.\n\n4. The `findAll` method now uses the `CriteriaQuery` and `Root` objects to define the criteria for the query. This is a more modern and efficient way to write queries in Quarkus compared to the `JPQL` syntax used in Java EE.\n\n5. The `findById` method now returns a `Mono<Order>` instead of a `List<Order>`. This is because Quarkus uses reactive programming model and the `Mono` type is used for asynchronous operations.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.persistence` package for persistence. In Quarkus, we need to use the `jakarta.persistence` package instead.\n2. The `Order` entity is mapped by default in Quarkus using the `@QuarkusEntity` annotation. So, there is no need to use the `@MappedBy` annotation in the Java EE code.\n3. The `findAll` method in the Java EE code uses the `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces from the `org.hibernate` package. In Quarkus, we can use the `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces from the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n4. The `findById` method in the Java EE code returns a `Mono<Order>`. In Quarkus, we can use the `Mono<T>` interface from the `io.quarkus.hibernate.reactive` module.", "1. Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` throughout the file.\n2. Update the entity manager to `EntityManager` and the criteria builder to `CriteriaBuilder` and criteria query to `CriteriaQuery` in the methods.\n3. Update the class name and annotations to use `@QuarkusStateless` and `@QuarkusEntity` with `mappedBy` set to `orderService`.\n4. Update the method names and parameters to use `@Inject` for dependency injection.\n5. Update the method implementation to use `persist` for saving an order.\n6. Update the findAll method to use `createQuery` and `setFirstResult` and `setMaxResults` for pagination.\n7. Update the findById method to use `find` for fetching an order by id.", "1. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created. For instance, an `ExtendedContext` qualifier can be created:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```\n\n3. In the `OrderService` class, the `@PersistenceContext` annotation is replaced with the `@Inject` annotation for the `entityManager`.\n\n4. The `findAll` method is updated to use the `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces from Quarkus. The `PageableBuilder` is used to build a pageable object.\n\n5. The `findById` method is updated to use the `find` method from Quarkus and map the result to the `Order` class.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation for the OrderService class, which indicates that it is a stateless session bean. To migrate this code to Quarkus, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation.\n2. Quarkus supports CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) as its dependency injection mechanism. We can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to replace the `@Stateless` annotation.\n3. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used to define a CDI bean with a scope of the application. This means that the bean will be created once per application and will be shared among all the components in the application."]
