The `CatalogService` class uses the `OrderService` bean, which is annotated with `@QuarkusService`.

The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` import statement, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. The `Order` class has a `@QuarkusData` and `@QuarkusTransformer` annotation, which indicates that it should be treated as a data class and used by Quarkus' reactive web framework.\n3. The `CatalogService` class uses the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `OrderService` bean, which needs to be updated to use `jakarta.inject`.\n4.
