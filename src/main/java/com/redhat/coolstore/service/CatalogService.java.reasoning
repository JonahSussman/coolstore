["1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for EJBs, while Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ejb` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.ejb` with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is a stateless session bean, so it can be migrated to a Quarkus `@QuarkusStateless` class.\n3. The `getCatalogItems()` method uses the `CriteriaBuilder` and `CriteriaQuery` to query the database, which can be replaced with Quarkus' `EntityGraph` and `GraphQL` capabilities.\n4. The `getCatalogItemById()` method can be simplified by using Quarkus' `Id` and `Entity` classes.\n5. The `updateInventoryItems()` method can be replaced with Quarkus' ` reactive-streams ` and `Observables` for asynchronous operations.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` import statement, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for compatibility with Quarkus.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is marked as `@QuarkusStateless`, indicating that it should be a Quarkus stateless service.\n3. The `getCatalogItems()` and `getCatalogItemById()` methods are annotated with `@GraphQL`, which indicates that they should be exposed as GraphQL APIs.\n4. The `updateInventoryItems()` method is annotated with `@Reactive`, which indicates that it should be implemented using Quarkus reactive programming features.\n5. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies into the class.", "1. The `javax.persistence` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation should be used for dependency injection.\n3. The `@QuarkusStateless` annotation should be used to mark the class as a Quarkus Stateless service.\n4. The `@GraphQL` and `@Reactive` annotations should be used to enable GraphQL and reactive programming features, respectively.\n5. The `EntityManager` provider should be injected using `@Inject` instead of the traditional `@Autowired`.\n6. The `emProvider.getEm()` method should be used to obtain the EntityManager instance instead of the traditional `em` field.", "1.

Use the `@Inject` annotation for dependency injection instead of the traditional `new` operator.\n4. Replace the `EntityManager` interface with `Jakarta EntityManager`.\n5. Use the `@GraphQL` annotation with the `@Reactive` method to enable GraphQL support.\n6. Update the `getCatalogItems()` method to use the `createQuery()` method with the `jakarta.persistence.Query` class.\n7. Update the `getCatalogItemById()` method to use the `find()` method with the `Jakarta EntityManager`.\n8. Update the `updateInventoryItems()` method to use the `merge()` method with the `Jakarta EntityManager`.", "1. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created. For instance, an `ExtendedContext` qualifier can be created:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```", "1. The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation on the `CatalogService` class, which indicates that it is a stateless session bean. To migrate this code to Quarkus, we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n2. The `CatalogService` class also uses the `@Qualifier` annotation, which is used to specify the name of the bean that should be used when injecting a dependency. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation instead of `@Qualifier` to specify the name of the bean.\n\n3. The `CatalogService` class uses the `@Target` and `@Retention` annotations to define the scope of the `ExtendedContext` annotation. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead of defining the `ExtendedContext` annotation manually."]
