["1. The `javax.ejb` package is being replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus.\n2. All the imports in the Java EE code need to be updated accordingly.\n3. The `CatalogService` class is a stateless session bean in Java EE, and it will remain the same in Quarkus.\n4. The `getCatalogItems()` method is used to retrieve a list of `CatalogItemEntity` objects. This method will remain the same in Quarkus.\n5. The `getCatalogItemById()` method is used to retrieve a specific `CatalogItemEntity` object by its ID. This method will remain the same in Quarkus.\n6. The `updateInventoryItems()` method is used to update the inventory quantity for a specific `CatalogItemEntity` object. This method will remain the same in Quarkus.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` annotation for dependency injection. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.inject` instead. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is a stateless session bean, so it should be annotated with `@Stateless` using `jakarta.ejb.Stateless`.\n3. The `EntityManager` is obtained from the `@Inject` annotated field, so it should be specified as `@Inject` using `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager`.\n4. The `CriteriaBuilder` and `CriteriaQuery` are obtained from the `@Inject` annotated field, so they should be specified as `@Inject` using `jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder` and `jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery`.\n5. The `Root` is obtained from the `@Inject` annotated field, so it should be specified as `@Inject` using `jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root`.\n6. The `getCatalogItems()` method now returns a `List` of `CatalogItemEntity` instead of an ` Iterable`.\n7. The `getCatalogItemById()` method now returns a `CatalogItemEntity` instead of a `Void`.\n8. The `updateInventoryItems()` method now takes an `InventoryEntity` as a parameter instead of a `CatalogItemEntity`.", "1.

The `@Inject` annotations are already using `javax.inject`.\n4. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is already using `jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext`.\n5. The `EntityManager` is already injected using `@javax.persistence.PersistenceContext`.\n6. The `CatalogItemEntity` class is already using `jakarta.persistence.Entity` and `jakarta.persistence.Id` annotations.", "1. We need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` in the `CatalogService` class.\n2. The `CatalogItemEntity` class should be annotated with `@Entity` using `jakarta.persistence.Entity` instead of `javax.persistence.Entity`.\n3. The `CatalogService` class should be annotated with `@ApplicationScoped` using `io.quarkus.arc.Arc` instead of `javax.ejb.Singleton`.\n4. The `getCatalogItems()` method should be changed to use `findAll()` instead of `createQuery()` and `getResultList()` since Quarkus does not support `createQuery()` out of the box.\n5. The `getCatalogItemById()` method should be changed to use `findById()` instead of `find()` since Quarkus does not support `find()` out of the box.\n6. The `updateInventoryItems()` method should be changed to use `merge()` instead of `merge()` since Quarkus does not support `merge()` out of the box.", "1. The `javax.persistence` package is being replaced with `jakarta.persistence` in Quarkus.\n2. The `CatalogService` class is being migrated to Quarkus.\n3. The `getCatalogItems()` method is being updated to use the new `jakarta.persistence` package.\n4.

In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created.\n\n3. For instance, an `ExtendedContext` qualifier can be created:\n\n   ```java\n   @Qualifier\n   @Target()\n   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n   public @interface ExtendedContext \n   ```\n\n4. Then, inject the entity managers using the `@ExtendedContext` qualifier:\n\n   ```java\n   @ExtendedContext\n   public EntityManager getEm() \n   ```", "1. The given Java EE code snippet uses the `@Stateless` annotation to define a Stateless EJB. In Quarkus, we can replace this annotation with a scope to define a CDI bean.\n2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used in Quarkus to define an application scoped CDI bean.\n3. The `CatalogService` class should be converted to a CDI bean with a scope of `@ApplicationScoped`."]
