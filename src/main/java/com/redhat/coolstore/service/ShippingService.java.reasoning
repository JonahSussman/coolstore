["1. The `javax.ejb` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. The `ShippingService` class is marked as `@Stateless`, which means it is a session bean and does not retain any state between method calls.\n3. The `ShippingService` class is marked as `@Remote`, which indicates that it can be invoked remotely.\n4. The `calculateShipping` method calculates the shipping cost based on the total amount of the shopping cart.\n5. The `calculateShippingInsurance` method calculates the shipping insurance cost based on the total amount of the shopping cart.\n6. The `getPercentOfTotal` method calculates the percentage of the total amount as a double value.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for the Stateless and Remote annotations. Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.ejb` package instead.\n2. The `ShippingService` class should be updated to use the `jakarta.validation` package for constraints.\n3. The `BigDecimal` class should be used instead of the `java.math.BigDecimal` class for consistency.\n4. The `List` class should be used instead of the `java.util.List` class for consistency.\n5. The `stream` method should be used instead of the `java.util.stream.Collectors.sum()` method for collecting elements to a sum.", "1. In Quarkus, Remote EJBs are not supported, so we need to replace their use with REST functionality.\n2. Replace the `@Remote` annotation with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")`.\n3. Remove `@Stateless` annotations since REST services are stateless by nature.\n4. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:\n   a. Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`.\n   b. Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and give it a proper endpoint path.\n   c. Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `@Stateless` annotation for the ShippingService class. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace it with a scope annotation.\n2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used for CDI beans in Quarkus. Therefore, we will replace the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. The `calculateShipping()` method is marked as `@Stateless`, so we need to update it to use the `@Inject` annotation for dependency injection.\n4. The `calculateShippingInsurance()` method is also marked as `@Stateless`, so we need to update it to use the `@Inject` annotation for dependency injection.\n5. The `shippingRate` and `shippingInsuranceRates` fields are annotated with `@NonNull` and `@Min`/`@Max`/`@Past` constraints. These constraints are not directly supported in Quarkus, so we need to find an alternative way to enforce them.\n6. The `calculateShipping()` method returns a `double` value, but Quarkus does not support returning primitive types from methods. We need to change the method to return a `BigDecimal` value.\n7.
