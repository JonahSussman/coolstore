["1. The `javax.ejb` package is being replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus.\n2. All `@Remote` and `@Stateless` annotations need to be updated to use the new package name.\n3. The import statement for `BigDecimal` should be updated to use the `java.math` package.\n4. The shipping insurance calculation method `calculateShippingInsurance()` should be moved to a new class named `ShippingInsuranceService`.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for EJBs, while Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ejb` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.ejb` with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `ShippingInsuranceService` class is a stateless session bean, so it should be marked as `@Stateless` using the `jakarta.ejb.Stateless` annotation.\n3. The `ShippingInsuranceService` class has a method `getPercentOfTotal()` that returns a function. Quarkus does not support this syntax, so we need to replace it with a regular method.\n4. The `calculateShippingInsurance()` method in the `ShippingService` class calls the `getPercentOfTotal()` method. We need to replace this call with a regular method call that returns a `Double` value.", "1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and add an endpoint to specify the actual path to the REST service.\n2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations as REST services are stateless by nature.\n3. Annotate every public method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET` and `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` with a proper endpoint path.\n4. Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed.", "1. We need to convert the `@Stateless` annotated beans to use `@ApplicationScoped` in Quarkus.\n2. The `ShippingInsuranceService` bean is a stateful session bean and should be converted to a Quarkus `@ApplicationScoped` bean.\n3. The `calculateShipping()` method is a GET method and should be converted to a Quarkus `@Path` method.\n4. The `calculateShippingInsurance()` method is a GET method and should be converted to a Quarkus `@Path` method.\n5. The `shippingInsuranceService` field should be removed and replaced with a dependency injection.\n6. The `getPercentOfTotal()` method should be replaced with a Quarkus function."]
