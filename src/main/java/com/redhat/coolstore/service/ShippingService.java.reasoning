["1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. However, since Quarkus is a microprofile implementation, EJBs are not used. Therefore, we can remove both the `@Stateless` and `@Remote` annotations as they are not needed in Quarkus.\n\n2. Next, we need to address the usage of `ShoppingCart` class. In Quarkus, we need to use the Dependency Injection (DI) framework to inject the dependencies. Therefore, we need to create a bean for the `ShoppingCart` class.\n\n3. We also need to remove the `getPercentOfTotal` method, as Quarkus provides a better way to handle such calculations using the `Math` class.\n\n4. Lastly, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any unnecessary dependencies and add the required Quarkus dependencies.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` package namespace used in Java EE.\n2. The next step is to update the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to `@Dependent`. Quarkus uses the CDI specification, but it has a different default scope. The `@Dependent` scope is the default scope in Quarkus, and it creates a new instance of the bean for each injection point.\n3. The `calculateShipping` method returns a `double` value, but it is recommended to use the `BigDecimal` class for currency calculations to avoid rounding errors. The `calculateShippingInsurance` method already uses `BigDecimal` for the calculation.\n4. The `calculateShipping` method can be simplified by using a `switch` statement instead of multiple `if-else` statements.\n5. The `calculateShippingInsurance` method can be simplified by using a single `if-else` statement with a range check.\n6. The `shoppingCart` field can be made `final`, and the `@Inject` annotation can be moved to the constructor. This approach is recommended in Quarkus because it allows for more flexible dependency injection.\n7. The `ShoppingCart` class needs to be updated to use the `jakarta.inject` package namespace instead of the `javax.inject` package namespace.", "1. The first step is to understand the current functionality of the ShippingService class in the JavaEE code. This class calculates shipping costs and insurance costs based on the total cost of items in a shopping cart.\n2. The next step is to address the issue found in the static code analysis. The issue is that the ShippingService class is using Remote EJBs, which are not supported in Quarkus. The solution is to replace the `@Remote` annotation with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path` and remove the `@Stateless` annotation.\n3. Since this class is not a REST service, we will not be converting it to a REST service. Instead, we will create a REST service that uses the ShippingService class to calculate shipping and insurance costs.\n4. We will create a new REST service class called `ShippingRestService` in the `com.redhat.coolstore.rest` package. This class will use the ShippingService class to calculate shipping and insurance costs.\n5. The `ShippingRestService` class will have two endpoints: one for calculating shipping costs and one for calculating insurance costs.\n6. The `ShippingRestService` class will have two dependencies: the `ShoppingService` class and the `javax.ws.rs.core.Response` class.\n7. The `ShoppingService` class will be injected into the `ShippingRestService` class using the `@Inject` annotation.\n8. The `ShippingRestService` class will have two methods: `calculateShipping` and `calculateInsurance`. These methods will call the corresponding methods in the `ShippingService` class and return the results as a `Response` object.\n9. The `calculateShipping` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will be annotated with `@GET` and `@Path(\"/calculateShipping\")`. The `calculateInsurance` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will be annotated with `@GET` and `@Path(\"/calculateInsurance\")`.\n10. The `calculateShipping` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will have a `ShoppingService` parameter annotated with `@Context`. This will allow the `ShippingService` class to be injected into the method.\n11. The `calculateShipping` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will return a `Response` object with the shipping cost as the entity.\n12. The `calculateInsurance` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will have a `ShoppingService` parameter annotated with `@Context`. This will allow the `ShoppingService` class to be injected into the method.\n13. The `calculateInsurance` method in the `ShippingRestService` class will return a `Response` object with the insurance cost as the entity.", "1. The first step is to understand the issue found from the static code analysis. The issue is that a Stateless EJB is used in the JavaEE code, which can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n2. In the provided JavaEE code, there is no usage of Stateless EJBs. However, there is a dependency injection of `ShippingService` using the `@Inject` annotation, which is a CDI feature. This suggests that the project might already be using CDI for dependency injection.\n\n3. In the JavaEE code, `ShippingService` is injected using the constructor injection pattern. However, Quarkus recommends using field injection for simplicity and consistency with CDI.\n\n4. The `@Context` annotation is used in the JavaEE code to inject the `ShoppingService` dependency. In Quarkus, this annotation is not needed for constructor or field injection.\n\n5. The `ShippingService` dependency is used in two methods: `calculateShipping` and `calculateInsurance`. In Quarkus, we can refactor the code to use a single method with a parameter to determine the type of calculation to perform.\n\n6. The `ShoppingService` dependency is not used in the constructor of `ShippingRestService`. Therefore, we can remove the constructor injection and use field injection instead.\n\n7. The `ShippingService` dependency is not used in any other classes. Therefore, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to ensure that a single instance of `ShippingService` is created and shared across all requests.\n\n8. The `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to include any required Quarkus dependencies. However, the provided JavaEE code does not include any Maven dependencies."]
