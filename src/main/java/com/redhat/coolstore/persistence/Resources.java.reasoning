["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `@Dependent` annotation is not directly supported in Quarkus, but it can be replaced with the `@QuarkusApplicationScoped` annotation.\n3. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is not directly supported in Quarkus, but it can be replaced with the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistence` qualifier.\n4. The `Resources` class is not directly supported in Quarkus, but it can be replaced with a Quarkus module.", "1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `PersistenceContext` is being replaced by `PersistenceContext.class` in Quarkus.\n3. The `UserTransaction` is being replaced by `UserTransaction.class` in Quarkus.\n4. The `EntityManager` is being replaced by `EntityManager.class` in Quarkus.\n5. The `SessionFactory` is being replaced by `SessionFactory.class` in Quarkus.\n6. The `UUID` class is being used in the code, so no changes are needed.", "1. The `javax.persistence` package is being used in the Java EE code, which is a Java EE specification. Quarkus, on the other hand, uses `jakarta.persistence` for persistence. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n2. The `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations are used for entity and table mapping in Java EE. In Quarkus, these annotations are part of the `jakarta.persistence` package. Therefore, we need to update the import statements for these annotations as well.\n\n3. The `Resource` class is used to provide resources for the application. In Quarkus, resources are typically provided by modules. Therefore, we need to refactor the `Resource` class into a Quarkus module.", "1. The `javax.persistence` package is being replaced with `jakarta.persistence` in Quarkus.\n2. All entity classes need to be annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations.\n3. The `ProductService` class should be moved to a `@QuarkusService` or `@ApplicationScoped` bean.\n4. The `@Autowired` annotation should be replaced with `@Inject` for dependency injection.\n5. The `org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotBlank` annotation is not supported in Quarkus, so it needs to be replaced with a different constraint annotation.", "1. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager.\n\n3. Otherwise, if the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.\n\n4. For instance, you can create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```", "1. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Therefore, we can remove the `@Qualifier` and `@Produces` annotations from the `ExtendedContext` interface.\n2. Instead of using the `@Named` annotation, we can use the `@Path` and `@GET` annotations to inject the `ExtendedContext` bean into the `UserResource` class."]
