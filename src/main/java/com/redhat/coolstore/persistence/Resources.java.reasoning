["1. To migrate the code to Quarkus, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n2. Similarly, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n3. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource.\n4. If using a `@Produces` annotation for the `EntityManager`, it is not needed after configuring the datasource, remove it and inject the `EntityManager` instead.\n5. If the producer is still needed, create a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM using `@Qualifier`, `@Target()`, and `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`.\n6. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.\n7. For the given field, we can use a `@Named` getter method instead."]
