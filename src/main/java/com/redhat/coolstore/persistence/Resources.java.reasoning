Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created.\n\n3. To create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier, we can use the following code:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```\n\n4. Now, we can inject our entity managers using the `@ExtendedContext` qualifier:\n\n```java\n@ExtendedContext\npublic EntityManager getEm() {\n    return em;\n}\n```", "1. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Therefore, we can remove the `@Qualifier` and `@Produces` annotations from the `ExtendedContext` interface.\n2. Instead of using the `@Named` annotation, we can use the `@Path` and `@GET` annotations to inject the `ExtendedContext` bean into the `UserResource` class."]
