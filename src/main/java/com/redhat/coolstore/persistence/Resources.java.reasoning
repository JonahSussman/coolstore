["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `@Dependent` annotation is not directly supported in Quarkus, but it can be replaced with the `@QuarkusApplicationScoped` annotation.\n3. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is not directly supported in Quarkus, but it can be replaced with the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistence` module.", "1. The `javax.enterprise` import statement should be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is a requirement for Quarkus as it uses the Jakarta EE specification.\n2. The `@Dependent` annotation should be updated to `@QuarkusApplicationScoped`. This annotation is used to scope the resource to the application scope in Quarkus.\n3. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation should be updated to use `@Inject` and the `@QuarkusPersistence` module. This annotation is used to inject the EntityManager into the resource.\n4. The `@Produces` method should be updated to use `@QuarkusProduces`. This annotation is used to produce the EntityManager in the Quarkus context.", "1. The `Resources.java` file is currently using the `javax.persistence` package for JPA annotations. To migrate this code to Quarkus, we need to replace this import with the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n2. The `@Dependent` annotation is used for application scoped beans in Quarkus. Therefore, we need to update it to `@QuarkusApplicationScoped`.\n3. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is used to inject the EntityManager in Java EE. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation and the `@QuarkusPersistence` module to achieve the same result.\n4. The `@Produces` method is used to provide the EntityManager in Java EE. In Quarkus, we can use the `@QuarkusProduces` annotation to achieve the same result.\n5. The persistence provider is currently using the Hibernate Persistence Provider. In Quarkus, we can use the `@QuarkusPersistence` module to set the persistence provider.", "1. The `Resources.java` file is currently using the `javax.persistence` package for JPA annotations.

Quarkus, however, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.\n\n2. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM should be created.\n\n3. For instance, an `ExtendedContext` qualifier can be created:\n\n```java\n@Qualifier\n@Target()\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface ExtendedContext {}\n```\n\n4. Then, inject the entity managers using the `@ExtendedContext` qualifier:\n\n```java\n@ExtendedContext\npublic EntityManager getEm() {}\n```", "1. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. This allows for more flexibility in dependency injection.\n2. The field `extendedContext` is accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead of the `@Produces` method."]
