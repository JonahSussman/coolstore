## Reasoning

1. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.

2. If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager.

3. If the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.

4. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier.

5. For instance, you can create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier:

```java
@Qualifier
@Target()
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface ExtendedContext {}
```

6. and then inject your entity managers:

```java
@ExtendedContext
public EntityManager getEm() {}
```

## Updated File

```java
@Dependent
public class Resources {

    @PersistenceContext
    @ExtendedContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Inject
    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {
        return em;
    }
}
```

## Additional Information

If you are using Quarkus and Spring Boot, you might need to add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` to ensure that the `@PersistenceContext` is resolved correctly:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.javax.persistence</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-jpa-2.1-api</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
