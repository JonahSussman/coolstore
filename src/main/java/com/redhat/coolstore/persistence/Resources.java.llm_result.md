 ## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The JavaEE packages have been migrated to JakartaEE and the package names have changed accordingly. We need to replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` for the `@Dependent` and `@Produces` annotations.

2. **Issue 3 & 4:** Similar to Issue 1 & 2, the JavaEE packages have been migrated to JakartaEE and the package names have changed accordingly. We need to replace `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence` for the `@PersistenceContext` and `EntityManager` classes.

3. **Issue 5:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed for injecting an `EntityManager` if it is correctly configured in the application.properties file. Since the `Resources` class is not adding any additional functionality to the `EntityManager`, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use `@Inject` instead.

4. **Issue 6:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed for injecting an `EntityManager` if it is correctly configured in the application.properties file. Since the `Resources` class is not adding any additional functionality to the `EntityManager`, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use `@Inject` instead. Also, we can use `@Named` annotation instead of `@Produces` annotation.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;

@Dependent
public class Resources {

    @Inject
    private EntityManager em;

    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {
        return em;
    }
}
```

## Additional Information

* Make sure to update the pom.xml file to include the JakartaEE dependencies instead of JavaEE dependencies.
* Also, make sure to configure the datasource in the application.properties file correctly for Quarkus to automatically create the `EntityManager` bean.
* If the `EntityManager` is used in other classes, make sure to update the imports to `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager` and use `@Inject` instead of `@PersistenceContext` and `@Produces`.
* If the `@Produces` annotation is still needed for some reason, make sure to add a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM as mentioned in the issue description.
