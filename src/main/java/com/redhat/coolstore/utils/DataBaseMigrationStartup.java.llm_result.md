## Reasoning

1. The first step is to replace the `javax.annotation` imports with their corresponding `jakarta.annotation` counterparts. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE 8 APIs, which have different package names than the Java EE 7 APIs used in the original code.
2. The reason for this change is that Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE 8, and the package names for the annotations have changed from `javax.annotation` to `jakarta.annotation`.
3. The same reasoning applies to the `javax.ejb` imports, which need to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` imports.
4. The `javax.sql.DataSource` import does not need to be changed, as it is part of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API and is not part of the Jakarta EE specification.
5. The `javax.inject` import also does not need to be changed, as it is part of the javax.inject project, which is not part of the Jakarta EE specification and is not affected by the migration to Quarkus.

        try {
            logger.info("Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay");
            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

There are no additional steps required at this time. However, it is important to note that this is only the first step in the migration process, and there may be other changes required to fully migrate the code to Quarkus. For example, the use of CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) may need to be updated, and the way dependencies are managed may need to change as well. Additionally, it may be necessary to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies and exclude any unnecessary dependencies.
