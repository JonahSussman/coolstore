## Reasoning

1. The first step in migrating this JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static analysis. These issues all relate to the package imports, which need to be updated from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace used in Java EE.

2. The first issue to address is the import statement on line 6, which uses the `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.annotation` package.

3. The second issue to address is the import statement on line 7, which uses the `javax.annotation.Resource` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.annotation` package.

4. The third issue to address is the import statement on line 8, which uses the `javax.ejb.Singleton` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.ejb` package.

5. The fourth issue to address is the import statement on line 9, which uses the `javax.ejb.Startup` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.ejb` package.

6. The fifth issue to address is the import statement on line 10, which uses the `javax.ejb.TransactionManagement` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.ejb` package.

7. The sixth issue to address is the import statement on line 11, which uses the `javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.ejb` package.

8. The seventh issue to address is the import statement on line 12, which uses the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation. This annotation needs to be replaced with the equivalent annotation from the `jakarta.inject` package.

9. After addressing these issues, the next step is to update the code to work with Quarkus. One major difference between Java EE and Quarkus is that Quarkus uses a different dependency injection mechanism, so the `@Inject` annotation used in this code will not work in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the `@Injectable` annotation to mark classes as injectable.

10. Another difference between Java EE and Quarkus is that Quarkus does not support EJBs, so the `@Singleton` and `@Startup` annotations used in this code will not work in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to mark classes as application-scoped beans.

11. Additionally, Quarkus does not support the `@TransactionManagement` and `@TransactionManagementType` annotations used in this code. Instead, Quarkus uses a different mechanism for managing transactions, which is based on the `@Transactional` annotation.

12. Finally, the `javax.sql.DataSource` class used in this code is not compatible with Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the `io.deployental.micrometer.jdbc.DataSourceFactory` class to create data sources.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.ejb.Singleton;
import jakarta.ejb.Startup;
import jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement;
import jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.deployental.micrometer.jdbc.DataSourceFactory;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@ApplicationScoped
public class DataBaseMigrationStartup {

    @Inject
    Logger logger;

    @Resource(mappedName = "java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS")
    DataSource dataSource;

    @PostConstruct
    private void startup() {


        try {
            logger.info("Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay");
            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

In addition to the changes mentioned above, it is also necessary to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies and remove any Java EE dependencies. This is because Quarkus uses a different dependency management mechanism than Java EE, and it is necessary to include all dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.

Additionally, it may be necessary to update any external dependencies that are used in the code, such as the Flyway database migration tool used in this code. This is because Quarkus may use different versions of these dependencies than Java EE, and it may be necessary to update the code to use the Quarkus-compatible versions of these dependencies.

Finally, it may be necessary to update any configuration files, such as the `application.properties` file, to include any necessary configuration for the Quarkus application. This includes configuration for the data source, as well as any other configuration that is necessary for the Quarkus application to run correctly.
