["1. The first step is to understand the issue found from the static code analysis. The issue is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace for its libraries, as it is the new home for Java EE technologies.\n2. Next, we need to address the fact that the `StartupListener` class implements `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` which is a WebLogic specific interface. Quarkus does not use WebLogic, so we will need to find a Quarkus equivalent or create our own.\n3. The `StartupListener` class injects a `Logger` using the `@Inject` annotation. In Quarkus, we can use the `io.quarkus.logging.Log` interface instead. This interface provides a simple way to log messages, and it is integrated with the Quarkus logging framework.\n4. We also need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any WebLogic dependencies and add Quarkus dependencies."]
