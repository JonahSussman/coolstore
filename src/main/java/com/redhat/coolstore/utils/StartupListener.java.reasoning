["The migration from Java EE to Quarkus involves several key steps and considerations, particularly focusing on compatibility, dependency management, and leveraging Quarkus' features for simplicity and performance. The static code analysis pointed out the need to replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`, which is part of the move from Java EE to Jakarta EE namespaces, a change that Quarkus has adopted.\n\n1. **Namespace Update**: The primary issue identified is the use of `javax.inject.Inject`, which needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject` to be compatible with Quarkus and Jakarta EE 9+ standards. This change is necessary due to the namespace shift from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` in the move from Java EE to Jakarta EE.\n\n2. **Application Lifecycle Management**: The original code uses `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener`, which is specific to WebLogic Application Server. Quarkus does not use server-specific APIs but relies on CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for lifecycle event handling. We'll migrate this to use CDI Observes method for startup and, if necessary, shutdown operations.\n\n3. **Logger Injection**: The original code uses `@Inject` for injecting a `Logger`. In Quarkus, we can directly use JBoss Logging, a simple logging facade. It allows for injecting loggers with `@Inject Logger`, but we'll need to adjust how we obtain the logger instance to be more Quarkus-friendly, utilizing `LoggerFactory`.\n\n4. **Dependency and Import Adjustments**: Alongside the code adjustments, we'll need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file is updated to include the Quarkus BOM and any specific dependencies we're using (e.g., for CDI and logging). This ensures that all Quarkus and Jakarta EE artifacts are correctly managed.\n\n5. **Simplifying Code with Quarkus Features**: Quarkus provides a lot of out-of-the-box features and extensions that simplify enterprise Java application development. Where possible, we'll leverage these to make the code more efficient and idiomatic to Quarkus."]
