["1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`. This is a requirement for migrating the code to Quarkus.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection, and it is a part of the `javax.inject` API. Therefore, we need to replace it with the `@Inject` annotation from the `jakarta.inject` module.\n3. The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` and `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` classes are used for managing the application lifecycle in the Java EE code. However, Quarkus provides its own implementation for these classes. Therefore, we need to replace these classes with the equivalent Quarkus classes.\n4. The `Logger` class is used for logging in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides its own implementation for the `Logger` class. Therefore, we need to replace the `Logger` class with the equivalent Quarkus class."]
