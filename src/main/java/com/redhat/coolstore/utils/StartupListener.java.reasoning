["1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. Quarkus does not support the `javax.inject` annotations, so we need to migrate to `jakarta.inject`.\n3. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection, and it is part of the `javax.inject` API.\n4. To migrate to `jakarta.inject`, we need to replace the `@Inject` annotation with `@Inject` with the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation.\n5. The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` class is used in the Java EE code, which is part of the Oracle WebLogic Server.\n6. Quarkus does not support the `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` class, so we need to migrate to a different solution.\n7. The `log` field is used for logging, and it is currently a local variable.\n8. To use Quarkus logging, we need to migrate the `log` field to a `@Inject` field.\n9. The `postStart` and `preStop` methods are used for application lifecycle events, and they are currently empty.\n10. To use Quarkus application lifecycle events, we need to update the `postStart` and `preStop` methods to use the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Order` annotations."]
