## Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Java EE code**: The given Java EE code is a simple `ApplicationLifecycleListener` that logs a message when the application starts and stops. It uses Weblogic-specific annotations and classes, which are not compatible with Quarkus.

2. **Removing Weblogic-specific code**: Quarkus does not support Weblogic-specific annotations and classes. Therefore, we need to remove the `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` and `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` imports and replace them with equivalent Quarkus classes. However, Quarkus does not have a direct equivalent for these Weblogic classes. Instead, we can use ArC, Quarkus's CDI implementation, to handle application lifecycle events.

3. **Replacing `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`**: Quarkus uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` namespace for its standard libraries. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.inject.Inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.

4. **Implementing a Quarkus-compatible `ApplicationLifecycleListener`**: We can create a Quarkus-compatible `ApplicationLifecycleListener` by implementing the `io.quarkus.arc.runtime.ApplicationLifecycle` interface and registering it as a CDI bean.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import io.quarkus.arc.runtime.ApplicationLifecycle;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener implements ApplicationLifecycle {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        // This method is called when the CDI container is initialized.
    }

    @Override
    public void performStop() throws Exception {
        // This method is called when the CDI container is being stopped.
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

    @Override
    public void performStart() throws Exception {
        // This method is called when the CDI container is being started.
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

We also need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any Weblogic-specific dependencies and add any necessary Quarkus dependencies. However, since the given Java EE code does not have any external dependencies, we do not need to update the `pom.xml` file in this case.
