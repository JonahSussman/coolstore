## Reasoning

The issue to be addressed is the use of the `javax.inject` package in the import statement of the `StartupListener.java` file, which needs to be replaced with the `jakarta.inject` package for Quarkus compatibility.

Quarkus is based on the Jakarta EE 8 platform, and the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) specification, which is now maintained under the Jakarta EE umbrella. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package instead of the `javax.inject` package for compatibility reasons.

To fix the issue, we need to update the import statement at line 6 of the `StartupListener.java` file as follows:

```java
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Logger;
```

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Logger;

public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Override
    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @Override
    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

There are no additional steps required for this migration step. However, it's important to note that Quarkus uses a different way to configure the application, and the `ApplicationLifecycleListener` interface might not be needed in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the `ApplicationScoped` annotation to define a bean that will be started when the application starts and stopped when the application stops.

Therefore, it's recommended to review the Quarkus documentation and consider refactoring the `StartupListener` class to use the Quarkus way of configuring the application.

Regarding the `pom.xml` file, there are no changes required for this migration step since the dependencies are already using the `jakarta.inject` package. However, it's important to ensure that the Quarkus dependencies are correctly configured in the `pom.xml` file for the rest of the migration steps.
