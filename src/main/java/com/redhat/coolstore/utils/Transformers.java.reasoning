["1. The `Transformers` class in the Java EE code imports the `javax.json` package. In Quarkus, we need to use the `jakarta.json` package instead.\n2. The `shoppingCartToJson` method uses the `Json` object to create a JSON string. In Quarkus, we can use the `Jackson` library to convert objects to JSON.\n3. The `jsonToOrder` method reads a JSON string and converts it to an `Order` object. In Quarkus, we can use the `Jackson` library to deserialize JSON to objects.\n4.
