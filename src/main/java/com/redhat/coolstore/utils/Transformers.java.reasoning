["1. The `Transformers` class in the Java EE code imports `javax.json`. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace this with `jakarta.json`.\n2. The `shoppingCartToJson` method uses `ThreadLocalRandom` to generate random names and emails. Quarkus does not have a built-in equivalent for this, so we need to find an alternative solution.\n3. The `jsonToOrder` method converts a JSON string to an `Order` object. We can use the same code for Quarkus, but we need to update the import statement and handle the JSON parsing differently.", "1.
