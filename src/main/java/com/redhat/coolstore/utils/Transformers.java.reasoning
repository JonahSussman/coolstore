["1. The `Transformers` class in the Java EE code imports `javax.json`. In Quarkus, we need to use `jakarta.json` instead.\n2. The `shoppingCartToJson` method uses `StringWriter` and `JsonWriter`. Quarkus provides `StringBuilder` and `JsonWriter` classes.\n3. The `jsonToOrder` method uses `StringReader` and `JsonReader`. Quarkus provides `StringBuilder` and `JsonReader` classes.\n4. The `toProduct` method creates a new `ProductImpl` object. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject existing objects.\n5. The `RANDOM_NAMES` and `RANDOM_EMAILS` arrays are static. In Quarkus, we should use `@Provided` for static members.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.json` library for JSON processing. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.json`. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of `javax.json` with `jakarta.json` in the `Transformers` class.\n2. The `ShoppingCart` class is also using `javax.json`, so we need to replace it with `jakarta.json` as well.\n3. The `jsonToOrder` method is now using `jakarta.json` for JSON processing.\n4. The `RANDOM_NAMES` and `RANDOM_EMAILS` arrays are now provided as `@Provided` beans, which are injected into the class.\n5. The `toProduct` method now uses `jakarta.json` for JSON processing.", "1.
