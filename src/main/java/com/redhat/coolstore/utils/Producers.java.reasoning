["1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required because Java EE has been renamed to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n2. The next step is to examine the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` parameter in the `produceLog` method. These are features of CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), which is a part of Jakarta EE. Quarkus also supports CDI, so there is no need to change this functionality.\n3. The `Logger` class is a part of the `java.util.logging` package, which is a standard logging facility in Java. Quarkus uses a different logging framework called SmallRye Reactive Messaging, but it also supports the `java.util.logging` package. Therefore, there is no need to change the logging implementation.\n4. The `produceLog` method creates a new `Logger` instance for the class of the injection point. This is a common pattern in CDI to create a logger for a specific class. This pattern is also valid in Quarkus.\n5. The `Producers` class does not have any dependencies on other Java EE technologies, such as JPA, EJB, or JMS. Therefore, there is no need to change any external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis. The input file has an import statement for `javax.enterprise.inject`, but the issue states that it should be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is necessary because Java EE specifications have been migrated to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n\n2. Since the input file only has one import statement that needs to be changed, we can simply replace `javax.enterprise.inject` with `jakarta.enterprise.inject` on line 4.\n\n3. There are no external dependencies or imports that need to be updated in the `pom.xml` file, as the issue only pertains to the import statement in the Java file.\n\n4. There are no other changes required for this Java file, as it does not contain any Java EE specific code that needs to be migrated.", "1. The issue found from the static code analysis is that the `@Produces` annotation is used with a method that has an `InjectionPoint` parameter, which is not necessary in Quarkus. In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation can be skipped if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.\n2. In this case, we can replace the `@Produces` annotation with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, which is a scope annotation, to indicate that the `produceLog` method will produce a single instance of `Logger` per application.\n3. We can also remove the `injectionPoint` parameter from the `produceLog` method, as it is not needed to determine the class name for the logger.\n4. We will also update the imports to use the `jakarta` package instead of `javax` package, as Quarkus uses the `jakarta` package for the Java EE APIs.\n5. We will also remove the `@Inject` annotation from the `log` field, as it is not needed in Quarkus."]
