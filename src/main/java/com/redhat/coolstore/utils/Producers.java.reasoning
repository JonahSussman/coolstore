["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus. Therefore, the import statement `import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;` needs to be updated to `import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;`.\n2. The `Logger` class is being replaced by `Logging` in Quarkus. Therefore, the `Logger` object needs to be updated to `Logging` object.\n3. The `InjectionPoint` class is being replaced by `InjectionPoint` in Quarkus. Therefore, the `InjectionPoint` object needs to be updated to `InjectionPoint` object.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.enterprise` package for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), while Quarkus uses `jakarta.enterprise` package. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n2. The `Logger` class is used for logging in the Java EE code, and it is not directly provided by Quarkus. We need to use the `slf4j-log4j12` binding to integrate it with Quarkus.\n3. The `InjectionPoint` class is used to retrieve information about the injection point in the Java EE code. Quarkus provides an equivalent called `InjectionPointProvider`.\n4. The `Producers` class is used to produce beans using CDI. We need to update it to use `@Inject` and `InjectionPoint` from Quarkus.", "1. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. Therefore, we should remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.\n2. Instead of using the `@Produces` annotation, we can use a `@Named` getter method to inject the `Logger` instance.\n3. The `@Inject` annotation is not required in Quarkus, as it is automatically detected and handled by the framework.\n4. The `Logger` class should be imported as `jakarta.logging.Logger` instead of `org.slf4j.Logger`."]
