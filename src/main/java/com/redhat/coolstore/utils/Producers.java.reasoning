["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `Logger` class is a standard Java class and does not require any special handling in Quarkus.\n3. The `@Produces` annotation is used to produce instances of beans in Quarkus.\n4. The `InjectionPoint` interface is used to retrieve information about the injection point in Quarkus.\n5. The `Logger` instance is being produced using the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` interface.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.enterprise` package for annotations. Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.enterprise` package for annotations. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\n2. The `Producers` class is annotated with `@Produces` and `@InjectionPoint` annotations. Quarkus provides equivalent annotations like `@QuarkusProduces` and `@QuarkusInjectionPoint`. We need to update these annotations accordingly.", "1. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. This allows for more concise and readable code.\n2. The field `logger` could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead. This would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n3. To fix the issue, we need to update the `Producers` class to use the `@Named` annotation instead of the `@Produces` annotation.\n4. We also need to update the `getLogger` method to use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `Logger` instance."]
