["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces`.\n2. The `Logger` class is being replaced by `Logging` in Quarkus. Therefore, we need to import the new `Logging` class instead of the `java.util.logging.Logger` class.\n3. The `getLogger()` method is being replaced by the `getOrCreate()` method in Quarkus. Therefore, we need to use the `getOrCreate()` method instead of the `getLogger()` method to create a new instance of the `Logger` class.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.enterprise` package for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). In Quarkus, we need to use the `jakarta.enterprise` package instead.\n2. The `Producers` class uses the `Logger` class from the `slf4j` library. Quarkus provides its own implementation of `Logger`, so we need to replace all instances of `Logger` with `QuarkusLogger`.", "1. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. This is because Quarkus provides a more flexible and expressive way to manage dependencies.\n2. The field `logger` could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead. This will make the code more readable and maintainable."]
