["1. The Java EE code imports `javax.annotation`. In Quarkus, we need to use `jakarta.annotation`. Therefore, we need to replace `javax.annotation` with `jakarta.annotation` throughout the code.\n2. The `@Resource` annotation is used to inject a DataSource. In Quarkus, the `@Resource` annotation is not required for this purpose. Instead, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the DataSource.\n3. The `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to execute code after the bean is constructed. In Quarkus, the `@PostConstruct` annotation is not required for this purpose. Instead, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to initialize the Flyway database.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.annotation` package for annotations. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.annotation`. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`.\n2. The `@Startup` and `@PostConstruct` annotations are used for container-managed transactions in Java EE. Quarkus supports container-managed transactions through the `@TransactionManagement` annotation. Therefore, we need to update the annotations to use `@TransactionManagement`.\n3. The `Flyway` database migration library is used to migrate the database. Quarkus has a built-in support for Flyway. Therefore, we need to replace the `Flyway` implementation with the Quarkus equivalent.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ejb` package for EJBs. However, Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.ejb` package. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` in the Java EE code.\n2. The `@Startup` annotation is used to initialize the database migration process. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@QuarkusApplication`. Therefore, we need to replace the `@Startup` annotation with `@QuarkusApplication` in the Java EE code.\n3. The `@TransactionManagement` annotation is used to manage transactions. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@Transactional`. Therefore, we need to replace the `@TransactionManagement` annotation with `@Transactional` in the Java EE code.\n4.

Therefore, we need to update the `@Transactional` annotation to use `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType.BEAN`.\n4. The `Flyway` class is used for database migration, and it is part of the Quarkus `db` module. Therefore, we need to add the `io.quarkus.db` dependency to the pom.xml.\n5. The `DataSource` is injected into the `DataBaseMigrationStartup` class, and it is part of the Quarkus `jdbc` module.

The `DataBaseMigrationStartup` class is an EJB that uses the `@Startup` and `@Singleton` annotations, which are not directly supported in Quarkus.
