Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`.\n2.

Quarkus supports this feature through its built-in support for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). Therefore, we can keep the same annotations without any changes.\n3.

The `@Startup` annotation is used to initialize the application context and resources at application startup. In Quarkus, this can be achieved using the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead.\n3. The `@TransactionManagement` annotation is used to manage transactions. In Quarkus, we can use the `@QuarkusTransactional` annotation instead, which provides a more flexible and feature-rich transaction management API.\n4. The `@Resource` annotation is used to inject resources, such as a DataSource, into the bean. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation instead, which provides automatic dependency injection.\n5. The `Flyway` library is used for database migration.
