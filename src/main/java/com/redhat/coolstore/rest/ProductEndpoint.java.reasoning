["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection in Quarkus.\n3. The `Product` class is being used for representing products in the application.\n4. The `ProductService` interface is being used for providing product data.\n5. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is used for managing the lifespan of the bean.\n6. The `@Path` and `@Consumes`/`@Produces` annotations are used for defining the endpoint and media types.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` import statement, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for compatibility with Quarkus.\n2. The `ProductEndpoint` class is marked as `@RequestScoped`, which means it should be scoped to the request. Quarkus provides the `@QuarkusApplicationScoped` annotation for this purpose.\n3. The `ProductService` is injected using the `@Inject` annotation, which needs to be updated to use `@Inject` with `jakarta.inject`.\n4. The `listAll()` method returns a `List<Product>`, which needs to be updated to use the `Stream` and `Collectors` APIs provided by Quarkus.\n5. The `getProduct()` method returns a `Product`, which needs to be updated to use the `Optional` and `Stream` APIs provided by Quarkus.", "1. Replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. Update the package name to `com.redhat.coolstore.rest.product`.\n3. Update the `Product` class to use `List` and `Optional` for better consistency and nullability handling.\n4. Use `Stream` and `Collectors` for better fluent API and reducing boilerplate code.\n5. Extract the `getProductByItemId` method into a separate utility class for better separation of concerns."]
