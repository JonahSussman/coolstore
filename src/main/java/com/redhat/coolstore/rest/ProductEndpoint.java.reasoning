["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection in Quarkus.\n3. The `Product` class is being used for representing products in the application.\n4. The `ProductService` interface is being used for providing product data.\n5. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is used for session scoped beans in Quarkus.\n6. The `@Path` and `@Consumes` annotations are used for defining RESTful endpoints and media types in Quarkus.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.inject` annotation, which is being replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus.\n2. The `ProductEndpoint` class should be updated to use the `@Inject` annotation from `jakarta.inject`.\n3. The `ProductService` should be updated to use the `@Inject` annotation from `jakarta.inject`.\n4. The `@RequestScoped` annotation should be replaced with `@ApplicationScoped` in Quarkus.\n5. The `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations should be updated to use the appropriate media types in Quarkus.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ws` package for RESTful web services. Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.ws` package for RESTful web services. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws` in the `ProductEndpoint.java` file.\n\n2. The `ProductEndpoint` class is marked as `@ApplicationScoped`, which is equivalent to `@RequestScoped` in Quarkus.\n\n3. The `Product` class is marked as `@Serializable`, which is not required in Quarkus. We can remove this annotation.\n\n4. The `ProductService` is injected using the `@Inject` annotation, which is supported in Quarkus."]
