## Reasoning

1. The first issue to fix is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This is because the `javax.ws` package is being deprecated in favor of `jakarta.ws` in Quarkus.

2. The second issue to fix is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws` on line 4.

3. The third issue to fix is to remove the JAX-RS activation configuration. This is no longer necessary in Quarkus as it handles activation automatically.

4. The fourth issue to fix is to remove the JAX-RS activation configuration on line 8.

## Updated File

Here is the updated `RestApplication.java` file for Quarkus:

```java
// Add the following import statement at the top of the file
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

// Update the package name to use `com.redhat.coolstore.rest.quarkus`
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest.quarkus;

// Update the `RestApplication` class to extend `Application` from `jakarta.ws.rs.core`
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```

## Additional Information

If you are using any other dependencies in your project, you will need to update their import statements as well. Also, make sure to update the `pom.xml` file to reflect the changes in the project dependencies.
