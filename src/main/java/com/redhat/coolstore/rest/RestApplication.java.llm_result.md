## Reasoning

1. The first and second issues are related to the import statements of `javax.ws.rs` package which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs` package. This is because Jakarta EE 8 and later versions have replaced the `javax.ws.rs` package with `jakarta.ws.rs` package. Quarkus being built on top of Jakarta EE, we need to make this change to be compatible.

2. The third and fourth issues are related to the `@ApplicationPath` annotation which is used for JAX-RS activation and setting the root path for the application. In Quarkus, there is no need to explicitly activate JAX-RS or set the root path as it is automatically detected and configured based on the presence of `Application` class annotated with `@ApplicationScoped` and the package structure.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}

```

## Additional Information

There are no additional steps required for this migration as the changes made are straightforward and only address the issues mentioned. However, it is important to note that Quarkus has a different way of handling dependencies compared to Java EE. In Quarkus, dependencies are managed using `dependencies.yml` file instead of `pom.xml`. Therefore, it is recommended to review the Quarkus documentation for managing dependencies and update the `pom.xml` file accordingly.
