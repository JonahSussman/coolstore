## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in the latest release. The `javax.ws` package is now `jakarta.ws`. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is built on Jakarta EE.

2. **Issue 3 & 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is not necessary as Quarkus automatically registers JAX-RS resources and providers. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is still used to set the root path for the JAX-RS application, but it's not required. If we want to keep the root path, we can use the `quarkus.resteasy.route.prefix` property in the `application.properties` file instead of annotating the application class.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

// @ApplicationPath("/services") // Commented out as it's not necessary in Quarkus
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```

## Additional Information

If you want to keep the root path for the JAX-RS application, you can add the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

```
quarkus.resteasy.route.prefix=/services
```

This will set the root path for the JAX-RS application without requiring the `@ApplicationPath` annotation.
