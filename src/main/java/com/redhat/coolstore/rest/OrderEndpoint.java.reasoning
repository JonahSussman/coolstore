["1. The Java EE code import statement `javax.enterprise` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is a requirement for migrating the code to Quarkus.\n2. The `Order` and `OrderService` classes are not part of the Quarkus standard library. They need to be migrated as well.\n3. The `@RequestScoped` and `@Path` annotations need to be updated to use Quarkus-specific annotations.\n4. The `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations need to be updated to use Quarkus-specific media types.", "1. The `javax.inject` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. The `Order` and `OrderService` classes are marked as `@RequestScoped`, which is not a Quarkus specific annotation. It can be removed.\n3. The `OrderEndpoint` class has `@Produces` and `@Consumes` annotations with the `APPLICATION_JSON` media type, which is not required in Quarkus. These annotations can be removed.\n4. The `OrderService` class is not used in the `OrderEndpoint` class, so it can be removed.\n5. The `OrderEndpoint` class has `@Inject` annotations for dependency injection, which is the recommended way to inject dependencies in Quarkus.", "1. The `javax.ws` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. The `Order` and `OrderService` classes are marked as `@RequestScoped`, which is not a Quarkus specific annotation. It can be removed or replaced with the appropriate Quarkus scope annotation (`@QuarkusApplicationScoped` or `@Singleton`).\n3. The `OrderEndpoint` class has `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations with the `APPLICATION_JSON` media type, which is not required in Quarkus. These annotations can be removed.\n4. The `orderService` field is marked as `@Inject`, which is a Quarkus feature. The `Inject` annotation can be replaced with `@Inject` directly.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ws` package for RESTful web services. However, Quarkus requires the use of the `jakarta.ws` package. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. The `Order` and `OrderService` classes are not directly related to the issue, but they should also be updated to use the `jakarta.ws` package.\n3. The `OrderEndpoint` class is the main class being updated.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ws` package for RESTful web services. However, Quarkus requires the use of the `jakarta.ws` package.

The `OrderEndpoint` class does not require any changes to the import statements.\n4. The `@Path` and `@Consumes` annotations have been moved from the `OrderEndpoint` class to the `Order` class.\n5. The `@Produces` annotation has been moved from the `OrderEndpoint` class to the `Order` class as well.\n6. The `OrderService` class has been updated to use the `jakarta.ws.rs` annotations.", "1.
