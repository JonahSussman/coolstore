["1. The `javax.ws` package is being used in the Java EE code. Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.ws` packages instead.\n2. The `RestApplication` class is being extended from the `Application` class, which is used for configuring the REST application.\n3. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to define the base path for the REST resources.", "1. The Java EE code uses the `javax.ws` package for RESTful web services. However, Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ws` package. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. The `RestApplication` class extends `javax.ws.rs.core.Application` to configure the RESTful web services. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to configure the application path.\n3. The `addFilter` method is used to register a filter for the RESTful web services. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to scope the filter.\n4. The `addServlet` method is used to register a servlet for the RESTful web services. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to scope the servlet.", "1. The Java EE code uses JAX-RS activation, which is no longer necessary in Quarkus.\n2. To fix this issue, we need to remove the JAX-RS activation from the RestApplication class.\n3. Instead, we can use the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to define the root path for the RESTful services.\n4. The `addFilter` and `addServlet` methods are no longer needed in Quarkus, as the framework handles routing and filtering automatically.\n5. The `SimpleTextFilter` and `SimpleTextServlet` classes are not required in Quarkus, as the framework provides built-in support for text filters and servlets.", "1. In the Java EE code, the `RestApplication` class has a `@Context` annotation on the `securityContext` field. This annotation is used to inject the security context into the application. In Quarkus, this annotation is not needed, as the security context is provided by the framework.\n\n2. The `addResteasyProvider` method is used to register a custom provider in the Resteasy container. In Quarkus, the provider can be registered directly in the application class without the need for a build step.\n\n3. The `addServlets`, `addFilters` methods are used to add servlets and filters to the application. In Quarkus, these methods are not needed, as Quarkus does not use servlets or filters by default."]
