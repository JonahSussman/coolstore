["1. The `javax.ws` package is being used in the Java EE code. Quarkus requires the use of `jakarta.ws` packages. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. The `RestApplication` class is being extended from the `Application` class. Quarkus does not have a direct equivalent to the `Application` class. However, we can create a `QuarkusApplication` class that extends the `QuarkusEngine` class.", "1. The `javax.ws` import statement is used in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws`. This is a requirement for migrating the code to Quarkus.\n2. The `QuarkusApplication` class should be extended instead of the `RestApplication` class.\n3. The `ApplicationPath` annotation should be added to the `RestApplication` class.\n4. The `ProductsResource` class should be moved inside the `RestApplication` class.\n5. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation should be added to the `RestApplication` class.", "1. The Java EE code uses JAX-RS activation, which is no longer necessary in Quarkus.\n2. Instead, we can set a root path in the QuarkusApplication class.\n3. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation should be added to the RestApplication class to set the root path.\n4. The ProductsResource class and its methods remain the same.", "1. The Java EE code uses JAX-RS activation, which is no longer necessary in Quarkus.\n2. To migrate the code to Quarkus, we need to extend the QuarkusApplication class and add the ApplicationPath annotation.\n3. The ProductsResource class remains the same, but we need to update the import statements to use the Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) API."]
