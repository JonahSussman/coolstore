["1. The first step is to understand the issue found from the static code analysis. The issue is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This is because Java EE has been renamed to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n2. The next step is to apply this change to the input file. In this case, the input file is `RestApplication.java`, and the issue is found on line 3.\n3. Replacing the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws` in the input file will resolve the issue.\n4. Since there are no external dependencies or imports that need to be updated, there are no further changes required for the `pom.xml` or imports.", "1. The first step is to understand the issue found from the static code analysis. The issue is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This is because Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n\n2. The input file is an empty Java EE application class annotated with `@ApplicationPath`. In Quarkus, we can achieve the same functionality using a `@Path` annotation on a resource class or a `@ResteasyJacksonProducer` annotation on a JAX-RS producer. However, since this is an empty application class, we don't need to make any changes to the functionality.\n\n3. Since this is an empty application class, there are no external dependencies to consider. Therefore, we don't need to make any changes to the `pom.xml` file.\n\n4. We need to change the package import statement from `javax.ws.rs.Application` to `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`.", "1. The issue found from the static code analysis is that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses a different approach for setting up JAX-RS than Java EE.\n\n2. In Quarkus, we don't need to extend the `Application` class to set up a JAX-RS application. Instead, we can use annotations to define the root path of our RESTful web service.\n\n3. To migrate the JavaEE code to Quarkus, we need to remove the `extends Application` from the `RestApplication` class and add the `@Path` annotation to define the root path of our RESTful web service.\n\n4. We also need to remove the unused import statement `import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;`.\n\n5. Since we are removing the `extends Application` from the `RestApplication` class, we need to make sure that there are no other dependencies on this class in the codebase. If there are, we need to update them accordingly.\n\n6. We don't need to make any changes to the `pom.xml` file as there are no external dependencies that need to be updated.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is related to JAX-RS activation which is no longer necessary in Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses a different approach for setting up the root path for the application.\n\n2. In Quarkus, the root path can be set using the `@ApplicationPath` annotation. However, since the `ResteasyReactiveApplication` annotation is being used, it is not necessary to set a root path.\n\n3. Therefore, the `@ResteasyReactiveApplication` annotation can be removed and replaced with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that the `RestApplication` class is a managed bean that is created once and then managed by the container.\n\n4. The `ResteasyReactive` class is not needed in the import statement since it is not being used in the `RestApplication` class.\n\n5. The updated file will not have any external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file since Quarkus uses a different build system and dependency management system than Java EE."]
