The Java EE code uses the `javax.ws` package for RESTful web services. However, Quarkus requires the `jakarta.ws` package. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. The `RestApplication` class extends the `Application` class, which is used to configure the RESTful web services.\n3. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to specify the base path for the RESTful web services.\n4. In Quarkus, the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is part of the `@QuarkusApplication` annotation.\n5. The `RestApplication` class can be updated to use the `@QuarkusApplication` annotation instead.", "1. Update the import statement in the `RestApplication.java` file to use the `jakarta` package instead of the `javax` package.\n2. Update the `RestApplication` class to use the `@QuarkusApplication` annotation instead of the `@Application` and `@Path` annotations.", "1. The Java EE code uses JAX-RS activation, which is no longer necessary in Quarkus.\n2. To fix this issue, we need to set a root path in the `RestApplication` class.\n3. The `@QuarkusApplication` annotation should be used to configure the JAX-RS client, security, and scanning settings.\n4. The `ClientConfigurers.jaxrsClientConfigurer` should be added to the `clientConfigurers` list to configure the JAX-RS client.\n5. The `Security.builder()` method should be used to configure the security settings, including the realm name and roles allowed.\n6. The `KeycloakSecurityExtension.class` should be registered as a scanning configurer to enable Keycloak security features."]
