["1. The first step is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise` as directed by the static source code analysis. This change is necessary because Java EE has been superseded by Jakarta EE, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of `javax`.\n\n2. The `@SessionScoped` annotation is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use `@ApplicationScoped` or `@RequestScoped` depending on the desired behavior. In this case, since the shopping cart is associated with a user session, we can use `@SessionScoped` from the `io.quarkus.arc.runtime.BeanManager` package. However, this annotation is not available in Quarkus, so we will have to manage the shopping cart in a different way. A possible solution is to use a thread-local variable to store the shopping cart for each user session.\n\n3. The `ShoppingCartService` is injected using the `@Inject` annotation. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation from the `javax.inject` package, which is compatible with Jakarta EE.\n\n4. The `ShoppingCart` and `ShoppingCartItem` classes are assumed to be available in the `com.redhat.coolstore.model` package. We need to ensure that these classes are available in the Quarkus project and that their dependencies are resolved.\n\n5. The `dedupeCartItems` method can be simplified using Java streams. We can use the `Collectors.groupingBy` method to group the shopping cart items by product ID and then calculate the total quantity for each group.\n\n6. We need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies and remove any unnecessary Java EE dependencies.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace for the Jakarta EE APIs.\n2. The next step is to replace any Java EE dependencies in the `pom.xml` file with their Quarkus equivalents. However, in this case, there are no external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file that need to be updated.\n3. The next step is to update any imports that are no longer needed in Quarkus. In this case, we can remove the `javax.ws.rs` and `javax.enterprise.context` imports, as they are not needed in Quarkus.\n4. Finally, we need to update the code to use the Quarkus REST API instead of the Java EE REST API. This involves changing the `@Path` annotation to use the Quarkus `@Path` annotation, and changing the `@Context` annotation to use the Quarkus `@RequestScoped` annotation.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This change is required because Java EE has been superseded by Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n\n2. In the given Java EE code, the package `jakarta.ws.rs` is used, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`. This change will affect the import statements as well as the annotations used in the class.\n\n3. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is a Java EE annotation, which is not required in Quarkus as it uses a different dependency injection framework. Therefore, we can remove this annotation.\n\n4. The `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni` class is used in the Quarkus code, which is a reactive programming library. If this class is not required, we can replace it with a blocking API. However, in this case, we will keep it as it is.\n\n5. The `TemplateInstanceBuilder` class is used to create a `TemplateInstance` object. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Template` annotation to define a template, and we can inject it using the `@Inject` annotation. Therefore, we can remove the `TemplateInstanceBuilder` class and use the `@Template` annotation instead.\n\n6. The `io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject` class is used to represent a JSON object. In Quarkus, we can use the `Map<String, Object>` class to represent a JSON object. Therefore, we can replace the `JsonObject` class with the `Map<String, Object>` class.\n\n7. The `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.Inject` annotation is used to inject the `CartService` class. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation provided by the Jakarta Dependency Injection (JDI) specification. Therefore, we can replace the `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.Inject` annotation with the `@Inject` annotation.\n\n8. The `TemplateProvider` interface is used to provide a template. In Quarkus, we can define a template using the `@Template` annotation. Therefore, we can remove the `TemplateProvider` interface and use the `@Template` annotation instead.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This change is required because Java EE and Quarkus use different packages for their dependencies. Java EE uses `javax` packages while Quarkus uses `jakarta` packages.\n\n2. In this specific case, the import statement that needs to be changed is `import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;`. It needs to be replaced with `import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;`.\n\n3. There are no external dependencies that need to be updated in the `pom.xml` file, as the issue is related to an import statement and not a dependency.\n\n4. There are no new imports required for this migration.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This change is required because Java EE and Quarkus use different packages for their dependencies. Java EE uses `javax` packages while Quarkus uses `jakarta` packages.\n\n2. The line number of the issue in the provided Java EE code is 13, and the import statement is already in the correct format, so no changes are needed for this step.\n\n3. Since there is no solved example provided, we will proceed with the migration based on best software engineering practices and the information provided.\n\n4. The input file name is \"src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/CartEndpoint.java\". We will update this file to work with Quarkus while keeping the same functionality.\n\n5. We need to ensure that the required dependencies are present in the `pom.xml` file. Since the provided Java EE code already uses Quarkus dependencies, we don't need to make any changes to the `pom.xml` file.\n\n6. We need to update the imports to use Quarkus-specific classes where necessary. For example, we will replace `javax.ws.rs.PathParam` with `io.quarkus.qute.TemplateProvider` and `io.quarkus.qute.TemplateInstance`.\n\n7. We will update the `@Path` annotation to use the Quarkus-specific `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.Inject` annotation.\n\n8. We will update the `@Produces` annotation to use the Quarkus-specific `io.quarkus.qute.Template` annotation.\n\n9. We will update the `TemplateInstance` to use the Quarkus-specific `TemplateInstanceBuilder`.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.

In this specific case, the import statement that needs to be changed is `import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;`. This import statement needs to be replaced with `import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;`.\n\n3. After making this change, we need to ensure that there are no other import statements that need to be updated. In this case, there are no other import statements that need to be changed.\n\n4. We also need to check if there are any changes required in the pom.xml file. In this case, there are no changes required in the pom.xml file since all the dependencies are already compatible with Quarkus.\n\n5. Finally, we need to ensure that the code is compatible with Quarkus. In this case, the code is already compatible with Quarkus since it uses the `@PathParam` annotation, which is a part of the JAX-RS specification, and Quarkus supports JAX-RS.", "1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This change is required because Java EE and Quarkus use different packages for their respective libraries. In this case, the `javax.ws` package is from Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the corresponding package in Quarkus, which is `jakarta.ws`.\n\n2. After making the necessary changes to the import statement, we need to check if there are any other dependencies that need to be updated. In this case, there are no other dependencies that need to be updated, so we can move on to the next step.\n\n3. The next step is to check if there are any annotations or configurations that need to be updated. In this case, there are no annotations or configurations that need to be updated, so we can move on to the next step.\n\n4. The final step is to test the updated code to ensure that it is working as expected. This can be done by running the Quarkus application and testing the endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.", "1. **Understanding the issue**: The issue identified from the static code analysis is related to the import statement of `javax.ws.rs`. Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace for its classes, and therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws.rs` import statement with `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n\n2. **Impact on dependencies**: This change does not directly affect the `pom.xml` file, as it only impacts the import statements. However, it is essential to ensure that the Quarkus version being used supports the `jakarta.ws.rs` package.\n\n3. **Impact on imports**: We need to replace the `javax.ws.rs` package with the `jakarta.ws.rs` package for the following imports:\n   - `import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;`\n   - `import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;`\n   - `import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response;`", "1. **Understanding the issue**: The issue identified from the static code analysis is related to the import statement of the `javax.ws.rs` package. This package is part of the Java EE API, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package from Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.ws.rs`. This change is necessary because Oracle has transferred the Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation, and the package names have been changed from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\n2. **Updating the import statement**: The first step is to update the import statement on line 17 from `jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType` to `jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType`. This change ensures that the code uses the correct package for the Jakarta EE API.\n\n3. **Impact on external dependencies**: Since the package name has changed, we need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file includes the correct dependencies for the Jakarta EE API. Specifically, we need to replace any dependencies that reference `javax.ws.rs` with the equivalent dependencies that reference `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n\n4. **Impact on imports**: Since we have updated the package name, we need to ensure that all the imports in the file are updated to use the `jakarta` package name instead of the `javax` package name."]
