## Reasoning

The first issue to address is the import statement at line 7 of the `ShoppingCart.java` file, which uses the `javax.enterprise` package. This package is part of the Java EE API, which is not directly compatible with Quarkus as Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API instead.

To fix this issue, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with the corresponding `jakarta.enterprise` import statement.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.model;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;

@Dependent
public class ShoppingCart implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = -1108043957592113528L;

	private double cartItemTotal;

	private double cartItemPromoSavings;

	private double shippingTotal;

	private double shippingPromoSavings;

	private double cartTotal;

	private List<ShoppingCartItem> shoppingCartItemList = new ArrayList<ShoppingCartItem>();

	public ShoppingCart() {
	}

	// getters and setters for shoppingCartItemList, cartItemTotal, cartItemPromoSavings, shippingTotal, shippingPromoSavings, cartTotal

	// methods for adding and removing ShoppingCartItem

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "ShoppingCart [cartItemTotal=" + cartItemTotal
				+ ", cartItemPromoSavings=" + cartItemPromoSavings
				+ ", shippingTotal=" + shippingTotal
				+ ", shippingPromoSavings=" + shippingPromoSavings
				+ ", cartTotal=" + cartTotal + ", shoppingCartItemList="
				+ shoppingCartItemList + "]";
	}
}
```

## Additional Information

No additional steps are required for this issue. However, it's important to note that as we continue to migrate the codebase to Quarkus, we may encounter other incompatibilities and will need to address them accordingly. Additionally, we may need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies.
