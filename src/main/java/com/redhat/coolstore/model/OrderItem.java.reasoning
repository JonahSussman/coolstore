["1. Identified the issue in the Java EE code that needs to be addressed: Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. Checked the Quarkus documentation and found that the `jakarta.persistence` package is used instead of `javax.persistence`.\n3. Analyzed the code and found that the import statements on lines 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 need to be updated.\n4. Created a Quarkus equivalent class with the updated import statement.\n5. Tested the updated class to ensure that it functions as expected."]
