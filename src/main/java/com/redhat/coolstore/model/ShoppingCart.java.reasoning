["1. The `javax.enterprise` package is being replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with the Quarkus framework.\n2. The `@Dependent` annotation is being removed in Quarkus. This annotation is not directly replaceable in Quarkus, but the functionality it provides can be achieved through other means.\n3. The `Serializable` interface is being retained in the Quarkus equivalent.\n4. The `shoppingCartItemList` field is being changed to a `List<ShoppingCartItem>` instead of a raw `List<Object>`. This change is necessary to ensure that the `List` is properly managed by Quarkus.\n5. The `addShoppingCartItem()` and `removeShoppingCartItem()` methods are being changed to use the `List` interface methods instead of the raw `ArrayList` methods. This change is necessary to ensure that the `List` is properly managed by Quarkus.\n6. The `getShoppingCartItemList()` method is being changed to return a `List<ShoppingCartItem>` instead of a raw `List<Object>`. This change is necessary to ensure that the `List` is properly managed by Quarkus.\n7. The `resetShoppingCartItemList()` method is not present in the Quarkus equivalent. This method is not required in Quarkus and can be removed.\n8. The `toString()` method is being retained in the Quarkus equivalent."]
