["1. The first step is to address the issue found from static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. In this case, the import statement to be replaced is `import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;`. This change is necessary because Java EE APIs have been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly.\n\n2. The next step is to examine the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file and update them as necessary. In this case, we need to replace any Java EE dependencies with their corresponding Jakarta EE dependencies. However, since the provided code does not include any external dependencies, we can skip this step.\n\n3. The next step is to examine the imports and update them as necessary. In this case, we need to replace any Java EE imports with their corresponding Jakarta EE imports. However, since the provided code only has one import to be replaced, we can focus on that.\n\n4. The final step is to update the code to use Quarkus APIs and features. Since the provided code is a simple Java class with no dependencies on Java EE APIs, there are no changes required in this step."]
