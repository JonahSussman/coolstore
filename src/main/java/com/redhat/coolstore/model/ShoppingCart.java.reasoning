["To migrate the given Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required due to the migration of Java EE to Jakarta EE, where the namespace has been changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. Quarkus, being a modern framework designed to work with Jakarta EE standards, requires this change for compatibility.\n\nAdditionally, we'll evaluate the use of CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans and scopes under Quarkus. The `@Dependent` scope in the provided Java EE code indicates that the lifecycle of the `ShoppingCart` bean is tied to the lifecycle of the bean that injects it. This behavior remains the same in Quarkus with Jakarta EE, so no change is needed for the scope annotation.\n\nNo other specific Quarkus configurations or annotations seem necessary for this simple model class conversion. However, it's essential to note that if this class interacts with other components (e.g., EJBs, JPA entities), further modifications might be required to ensure full compatibility with Quarkus, including potential updates to the `pom.xml` file to include Quarkus dependencies and possibly Jakarta EE APIs if they are used elsewhere in the project.\n\nFor the `pom.xml`, ensure to include the Quarkus BOM and any specific Quarkus extensions needed for full application functionality. Since this example doesn't specify external dependencies beyond CDI, no specific Quarkus extensions are identified at this stage.\n\nNow, let's update the provided Java EE class to be compatible with Quarkus."]
