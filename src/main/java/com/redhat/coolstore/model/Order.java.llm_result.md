## Reasoning

The given Java EE file `Order.java` contains several `javax.persistence` imports that need to be replaced with their corresponding Jakarta Persistence API counterparts, `jakarta.persistence`, in order to migrate the code to Quarkus. Quarkus is based on the Jakarta EE platform, and the Jakarta Persistence API is a key component of it.

Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE APIs, which are the successors to the Java EE APIs. The Jakarta EE APIs are fully compatible with the Java EE APIs, but they have different package names.

Here's the step-by-step process to replace the `javax.persistence` imports with `jakarta.persistence`:

1. Identify the `javax.persistence` imports that need to be replaced. In this case, all the imports starting with `javax.persistence` need to be replaced.
2. Replace each `javax.persistence` import statement with the corresponding `jakarta.persistence` import statement.
3. Save the file after making the changes.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.model;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import jakarta.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "ORDERS")
public class Order implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = -1L;

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private long orderId;

	private String customerName;

	private String customerEmail;

	private double orderValue;

	private double retailPrice;

	private double discount;

	private double shippingFee;

	private double shippingDiscount;

	@Column(name="TOTAL_PRICE")

	@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	@JoinColumn(name="ORDER_ID")
	private List<OrderItem> itemList = new ArrayList<>();

	public Order() {}

	// Getters and setters

}
```

## Additional Information

After updating the imports, you may need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Jakarta Persistence API dependency. You can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId> jakarta.persistence </groupId>
    <artifactId> jakarta.persistence-api </artifactId>
    <version> 2.2.3 </version>
</dependency>
```

This dependency will ensure that the Jakarta Persistence API is available during the build process.
