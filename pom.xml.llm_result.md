Model ID: mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01

## Reasoning

1. Issue 1: The `javax` groupId is no longer used in Jakarta EE. It has been replaced with `com.sun.activation`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with JBoss EAP 7.3 or later.

2. Issue 2, 3, 4, 5: The `javax` groupId is no longer used in Jakarta EE. It has been replaced with `jakarta.platform`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE.

3. Issue 6: Quarkus does not support JavaEE/Jakarta JMS. It is recommended to use Quarkus' SmallRye Reactive Messaging instead.

4. Issue 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: These issues are related to the use of the Quarkus BOM, Maven Compiler plugin, Maven Surefire plugin, Maven Failsafe plugin, and a Maven profile for the Quarkus native build. These changes are necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

5. Issue 13, 14: The `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency is no longer needed as it has been replaced with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`.

## Additional Information

* The `packaging` element has been changed from `war` to `jar` as Quarkus does not support `war` packaging.

* The `<maven.home>$</maven.home>` system property variable has been added to the Surefire and Failsafe plugins to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.
* The `<properties>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to store the version numbers for the dependencies and plugins.
* The `<dependencyManagement>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to manage the versions of the dependencies.
* The `<build>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to store the build configurations.
* The `<plugins>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to store the plugin configurations.
* The `<profiles>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to store the Maven profile configurations.
* The `<profile>` section has been added to the `pom.xml` file to store the native build profile configuration.
* The `<activation>` section has been added to the `<profile>` section to enable the native build profile when the `native` property is present.
* The `<properties>` section has been added to the `<profile>` section to store the properties for the native build profile.
* The `<quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>` property has been added to the `<properties>` section of the native build profile to enable the Quarkus native build.
